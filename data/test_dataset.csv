What is the effect of adding exemplar replay (ER) on the performance metrics s1 and s2 in Phase 2 and Phase 3?,"Exemplar replay (ER) yields notable gains for s1 in Phase 2 (+18.51%) and Phase 3 (+10.38%), and also improves s2 in Phase 3 (+9.43%).","10THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D Effect of ER.Adding exemplar replay (row 3) partially alleviates forgetting by maintaining a buffer of past examples. This yields notable gains fors1in Phase 2 (+18.51%) and Phase 3 (+10.38%), and also improvess2in Phase 3 (+9.43%). However, the overall forgetting remains substantial (FPP: 46.44), showing ER alone is insufficient."
What evaluation metrics are used to assess the method in the context of 3DSS?,Mean Average Precision (mAP) and mean Intersection over Union (mIoU).,"8THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D assessing real-world scenarios. In addition, we compare our approach against existing incremental learning methods using ScanNetV2 [16] in the 3DSS setting. For this evaluation, we follow the standard training and validation splits defined in prior works [74] to ensure consistency with existing methods. Evaluation Metrics. We evaluate our method using Mean Average Precision (mAP), a standard metric for 3DIS which provides a comprehensive measure of segmentation quality by accounting for both precision and recall. For comparison with existing 3DSS methods, we report the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), which quantifies the overlap between."

What is the primary purpose of the imbalance correction (IC) module as described in the context?,The primary purpose of the imbalance correction (IC) module is to address the performance gap for rare classes.,"E. Appendix C Evaluation on Rare Categories The proposed imbalance correction (IC) module, as detailed in Section 4.2, is designed to address the performance gap for rare classes. To assess its impact, we compare its performance with the framework which has exemplar replay (ER) and knowledge distillation (KD). Specifically, we focus on its ability to improve performance for rare classes, which the model encounters infrequently compared to more common classes. The results, shown in Tab. 5 and Tab. 6, correspond to evaluations on Split-A for Phase 2 and Phase 3, respectively. In Phase 2, we evaluate classes seen 1–20 times per epoch."
What does the variable C represent in the context of CI-3DIS methods?,C represents the number of object categories.,"While CI-3DIS methods offer a wide range of practical applications, they frequently rely on the assumption of uniform sample distribution, which rarely holds in real-world settings. In practice, the number of object categories, denoted by C, is often large and characterised."
What is a limitation of transformer-based models applied to 3DIS and 3DSS?,They require full annotations for all classes and are not designed for progressive learning.,"ing [9, 21, 22, 29, 37, 44, 70, 78]. In contrast, proposal-based methods follow a top-down strategy by detecting 3D boxes and segmenting objects within them [19, 26, 46, 73, 76]. Recently, transformer-based models [68] have also been applied to 3DIS and 3DSS [59, 64], inspired by advances in 2D vision [10, 11]. However, these approaches require full annotations for all classes and are not designed for progressive learning, where only new class annotations are available and previous data is inaccessible. Another line of work aims to re-duce annotation costs by proposing weakly supervised 3DIS methods based on sparse cues."
What is the purpose of introducing the Split-C scenario in data labelling?,The purpose of introducing the Split-C scenario is to improve the model's robustness in real-world situations where labelled data availability is inconsistent by exposing it to diverse and unpredictable distributions.,"infrequent categories within a single task, focusing on semantic continuity and transfer. Split-C: Random Scenarios.In some cases, data labelling is driven by the availability of objects rather than predefined criteria. To capture this, we introduce theSplit-Cscenario, which represents a fully random setting where any class can appear in any task, resulting in varying levels of class imbalance. By exposing the model to such diverse and unpredictable distributions, we aim to improve its robustness in real-world situations where labelled data availability is inconsistent. These incremental scenarios are designed to provide a more realistic representation of"
What are the two strategies introduced to better preserve past representations and enhance generalization across phases in the context of limited exemplar budgets?,PLG and CBR.,"phaset, and|E t |denotes the exemplar replay size. The combined replay dataset is denoted as:D t ER =D t ∪E 1:t−1.Epoch training consists of two stages: first, the model is trained on the current data,D t ; then it is trained using exemplars fromE 1:t−1. While previous CI-3DIS approaches rely on large exemplar sets to mitigate forgetting [4], such strategies become impractical under memory constraints. Consequently, although ER aids knowledge retention, it is insufficient on its own for robust performance with a limited exemplar budget. Therefore, PLG and CBR are introduced to better preserve past representations and enhance generalisation across phases."
What is the average boost in performance provided by the IC module in Phase 2?,8.32%,"2andPhase 3, respectively. InPhase 2, we evaluate classes seen 1–20 times per epoch, whilePhase 3targets even less frequent classes, with observations limited to 1–10 times per epoch. As illustrated in Tab. 5, the IC module substantially improves performance on rare classes in terms of mAP 50 in Phase 2 ofSplit-A. For instance, classes likerecycling binandtrash bin, seen only 3 and 7 times, respectively, shows significant improvement when the IC module is applied. Overall, the IC module provides an average boost of 8.32%, highlighting its effectiveness in mitigating class imbalance. Similarly, Tab. 6 presents results forPhase 3, demonstrating significant gains for infre-"

What is the purpose of the Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR) in the pseudo-label generation process?,The purpose of Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR) is to weight the pseudo-labels based on class frequency f(c) to ensure a balanced pseudo-label set.,"which maintains a small memory of past examples. These are then passed to the current modelΦ t to produce predicted labelsY t . The Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG) selects the top-K predictions from the previous modelΦ t−1 . These pseudo-labels are then weighted based on class frequencyf(c)using Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR), and the top-K re-weighted labels are selected to form the balanced pseudo-label set ¯Yt . This pseudo-label set is then concatenated with the ground-truth labels to form a final augmented supervision set Yt for taskt, which is used to optimise the modelΦ t using Eq. (3)."

What is one common strategy used in incremental learning to mitigate catastrophic forgetting?,"Model regularisation, which constrains parameter updates using techniques such as elastic weight consolidation or knowledge distillation.","duce annotation costs by proposing weakly supervised 3DIS methods based on sparse cues [12, 27, 72]. While effective with limited annotations, these methods assume a fixed set of classes and are susceptible to catastrophic forgetting in incremental settings. Incremental Learning.Continual learning involves training models sequentially to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. One common strategy is model regularisation, which constrains parameter updates using techniques such as elastic weight consolidation or knowledge distillation [1, 24, 35, 43, 60]. Another approach is exemplar replay, where past data is stored."
