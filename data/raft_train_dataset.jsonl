Overall, our proposed\nmethod improves mAP by 5.6%. In this supplementary material, we first demonstrate the performance gains on rare classes\nachieved by incorporating the IC module in Appendix C. Next, we provide detailed split in-\nformation for all scenarios, based on class names, in Appendix D. Finally, we present a qual-\nitative comparison between the baseline method and our proposed approach in Appendix\nE. Appendix C Evaluation on Rare Categories\nThe proposed imbalance correction (IC) module, as detailed in Section 4.2, is designed to\naddress the performance gap for rare classes. To assess its impact, we compare its perfor-\nmance with the framework which has exemplar replay (ER) and knowledge distillation (KD). Specifically, we focus on its ability to improve performance for rare classes, which the model\nencounters infrequently compared to more common classes. The results, shown in Tab.\n\nOn average, the addition of the proposed IC module into the framework outperforms ER+KD by 12.13%.\n\n5 and Tab. 6, correspond to evaluations onSplit-AforPhase\n2andPhase 3, respectively. InPhase 2, we evaluate classes seen 1–20 times per epoch,\nwhilePhase 3targets even less frequent classes, with observations limited to 1–10 times per\nepoch. As illustrated in Tab. 5, the IC module substantially improves performance on rare\nclasses in terms of mAP 50 in Phase 2 ofSplit-A. For instance, classes likerecycling\nbinandtrash bin, seen only 3 and 7 times, respectively, shows significant improvement\nwhen the IC module is applied. Overall, the IC module provides an average boost of 8.32%,\nhighlighting its effectiveness in mitigating class imbalance. Similarly, Tab. 6 presents results forPhase 3, demonstrating significant gains for infre-\nquent classes. For example, even though the classes such aspiano,bucket, andlaundry\nbasketare observed only once, IC module improves the performance by 52.30%, 10.40%,\nand 13.60%, respectively. The ER+KD module does not focus on rare classes likeshower\nandtoasterwhich results in low performance, but the IC module compensates for this imbal-\nance by focusing on underrepresented categories.

Appendix E Qualitative Results\nIn this section, we present a qualitative comparison of the proposed framework with the\nbaseline method. Fig. 4 illustrates the results on theSplit-Aevaluation after learning all\ntasks, comparing the performance of the baseline method and our proposed approach.

However, this assumption is unrealistic in dynamic, real-world environments where new\nclasses emerge gradually and exhibit natural imbalance. Although some approaches ad-\ndress the emergence of new classes, they often overlook class imbalance, which leads\nto suboptimal performance, particularly on rare categories. To tackle this, we propose\nCLIMB-3D, a unified framework forCLass-incrementalImbalance-aware3DIS. Build-\ning upon established exemplar replay (ER) strategies, we show that ER alone is insuf-\nficient to achieve robust performance under memory constraints. To mitigate this, we\nintroduce a novel pseudo-label generator (PLG) that extends supervision to previously\nlearned categories by leveraging predictions from a frozen model trained on prior tasks. Despite its promise, PLG tends to be biased towards frequent classes. Therefore, we\npropose a class-balanced re-weighting (CBR) scheme that estimates object frequencies\nfrom pseudo-labels and dynamically adjusts training bias, without requiring access to\npast data. We design and evaluate three incremental scenarios for 3DIS on the challeng-\ning ScanNet200 dataset and additionally validate our method for semantic segmentation\non ScanNetV2. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing prior work by\nup to 16.76% mAP for instance segmentation and approximately 30% mIoU for semantic\nsegmentation, demonstrating strong generalisation across both frequent and rare classes.

However, this assumption is unrealistic in dynamic, real-world environments where new\nclasses emerge gradually and exhibit natural imbalance. Although some approaches ad-\ndress the emergence of new classes, they often overlook class imbalance, which leads\nto suboptimal performance, particularly on rare categories. To tackle this, we propose\nCLIMB-3D, a unified framework forCLass-incrementalImbalance-aware3DIS. Build-\ning upon established exemplar replay (ER) strategies, we show that ER alone is insuf-\nficient to achieve robust performance under memory constraints. To mitigate this, we\nintroduce a novel pseudo-label generator (PLG) that extends supervision to previously\nlearned categories by leveraging predictions from a frozen model trained on prior tasks. Despite its promise, PLG tends to be biased towards frequent classes. Therefore, we\npropose a class-balanced re-weighting (CBR) scheme that estimates object frequencies\nfrom pseudo-labels and dynamically adjusts training bias, without requiring access to\npast data. We design and evaluate three incremental scenarios for 3DIS on the challeng-\ning ScanNet200 dataset and additionally validate our method for semantic segmentation\non ScanNetV2. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing prior work by\nup to 16.76% mAP for instance segmentation and approximately 30% mIoU for semantic\nsegmentation, demonstrating strong generalisation across both frequent and rare classes.

After every phase, the model must recognise both newly added\nand previously learned classes. For instance, in Task 2, categories such asPillow,Coffee\nTable, andSofa Chairare introduced, while the model is expected to retain recognition\nof earlier classes likeTable,Chair, andCouch. 3D instance segmentation (3DIS) is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves\nidentifying precise object boundaries and class labels in 3D space, with broad applications in\ngraphics, robotics, and augmented reality [4, 39]. Traditional 3DIS methods, including top-\ndown [28, 70, 78], bottom-up [26, 73], and transformer-based approaches [59], perform well\nunder the assumption that all classes are available and balanced during training. However,\nthis assumption does not hold in real-world environments, where new object classes emerge\nover time and exhibit natural imbalance. This gap motivates the need for Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) [17, 54], which sup-\nports learning new categories while retaining knowledge of previous ones [51]. While CIL\nhas seen success in 2D image tasks [1, 43, 54, 60], extensions to 3D point clouds remain\nlimited, often focusing on object-level classification [13, 18, 48]. Recent works on scene-\nlevel class-incremental 3DIS (CI-3DIS) [4] and class-incremental semantic segmentation\n(CI-3DSS) [74] show promise, but depend heavily on large exemplar [56] and overlook class\nimbalance, limiting their practicality. To address this, we proposeCLIMB-3D, a unified framework forCLass-incremental\nIMBalance-aware3DIS that jointly tackles catastrophic forgetting and class imbalance. The\nframework begins with Exemplar Replay (ER), storing a small number of samples from\npast classes for later replay. However, this alone does not yield promising results under the\nstrict memory constraints required in CI-3DIS. To address this, we introduce a Pseudo-Label\nGenerator (PLG), which uses a frozen model from previous task to generate supervision for\nearlier classes. However, we observed that PLG tends to favour frequent classes while ig-\nnoring under-represented ones. To mitigate this, we propose a Class-Balanced Re-weighting\n(CBR), which estimates class frequencies from the pseudo-labels to enhance the learning of\nrare classes without accessing past data. Together, these components form a practical and\neffective solution for real-world 3DIS. To evaluate CLIMB-3D, we designed three benchmark scenarios for CI-3DIS based on\nthe ScanNet200 dataset [57]. These scenarios simulate incremental learning setup under nat-\nural class imbalance, where new classes emerge based on (A) object frequency, (B) semantic\nsimilarity, or (C) random grouping. Additionally, for comparison with existing methods,\nwe evaluate our approach on CI-3DSS using the ScanNetV2 dataset [16]. Experimental re-\nsults show that our method significantly reduces forgetting and improves performance across\nboth frequent and rare categories, outperforming previous methods in both settings. Fig. 1\nillustrates the CI-3DIS setup. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D3\nIn summary, our contributions are: (i) a novel problem setting of imbalanced class-\nincremental 3DIS with an effective method to balance learning and mitigate forgetting; (ii)\nthree benchmarks modelling continual object emergence with natural imbalance; and (iii)\nstrong experimental results, achieving up to 16.76% mAP improvement over baselines. 2 Related Work\n3D Instance Segmentation.Various methods have been proposed for 3DIS. Grouping-\nbased approaches adopt a bottom-up pipeline that learns latent embeddings for point cluster-\ning [9, 21, 22, 29, 37, 44, 70, 78]. In contrast, proposal-based methods follow a top-down\nstrategy by detecting 3D boxes and segmenting objects within them [19, 26, 46, 73, 76]. Recently, transformer-based models [68] have also been applied to 3DIS and 3DSS [59, 64],\ninspired by advances in 2D vision [10, 11]. However, these approaches require full anno-\ntations for all classes and are not designed for progressive learning, where only new class\nannotations are available and previous data is inaccessible. Another line of work aims to re-\nduce annotation costs by proposing weakly supervised 3DIS methods based on sparse cues\n[12, 27, 72]. While effective with limited annotations, these methods assume a fixed set of\nclasses and are susceptible to catastrophic forgetting in incremental settings. Incremental Learning.Continual learning involves training models sequentially to miti-\ngate catastrophic forgetting. One common strategy is model regularisation, which constrains\nparameter updates using techniques such as elastic weight consolidation or knowledge dis-\ntillation [1, 24, 35, 43, 60]. Another approach is exemplar replay, where past data is stored\nor generated to rehearse older tasks while learning new ones [5, 7, 30, 54]. A third direc-\ntion involves dynamically expanding the model architecture or using modular sub-networks\nto accommodate new tasks without interfering with old ones [31, 42, 53, 58, 71, 79]. Re-\ncent efforts in class-incremental 3D segmentation [63, 74] have shown early promise but\noften rely on basic architectures and focus primarily on semantic segmentation. Other works\n[4, 36] explore continual learning in 3D settings, though they often depend on large memory\nbuffers. In contrast, our work introduces a tailored framework for 3D instance segmentation\nthat effectively transfers knowledge across tasks, even under class imbalance. Long-tailed Recognition.Imbalanced class distributions lead to poor recognition of rare\n(long-tail) classes. To address this, re-sampling methods balance the data via input [8, 20, 50,\n52, 61] or feature space [3, 14, 40], avoiding naïve under-/over-sampling. Loss re-weighting\noffers another direction, using class-based [6, 15, 23, 32, 33, 69] or per-example [45, 55, 62]\nadjustments to ensure fair contribution. Parameter regularisation improves generalisation\nthrough weight constraints [2], albeit requiring careful tuning. Other approaches leverage\ntransfer learning [77, 81], self-supervision [41, 75], or contrastive learning [34, 41, 82] to\nimprove rare-class representations. Long-tailed recognition is well-studied in 2D with large-\nscale datasets [15, 49, 67]; in 3D, ScanNet200 [16, 57] enables similar efforts. Prior 3D\nwork focused on re-weighting, re-sampling, and transfer learning [57], while regularisation\nremains underexplored. CeCo [80] balances class centres via auxiliary loss but overlooks\nsampling and augmentation. Lahoud et al. [38] propose adaptive classifier regularisation\nfor 3D segmentation, outperforming prior approaches without threshold tuning. However,\nneither method considers incremental learning. In contrast, we jointly address long-tail and\ncontinual 3D semantic segmentation. 4THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D\nFeature \nBackbone\nTransformer \nDecoder\nFeature \nBackbone\nTransformer \nDecoder\n(𝑷,𝒀𝑡)\nCurrent model (𝛷\n𝑡\n)\nPseudo Label Generator (PLG) \nSelection\n෨𝑌𝐾\n𝑡\nℒCI−3DIS\n෨𝑌𝐾\n𝑡,𝑤\nത𝑌𝐾\n𝑡\n෠𝑌𝑡\n(𝐷𝑡)\nCurrent Dataset \nExemplar \nReplay (ER)\n+\n~\nClass-Balanced  \nRe-weighting \n(CBR)\n1\n𝑓(𝑐)\nFigure 2: Overview ofCLIMB-3Dfor CI-3DIS.

These are then passed to the current\nmodelΦ t to produce predicted labelsY t . The Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG) selects the\ntop-Kpredictions from the previous modelΦ t−1 . These pseudo-labels are then weighted\nbased on class frequencyf(c)using Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR), and the top-Kre-\nweighted labels are selected to form the balanced pseudo-label set ¯Yt . This pseudo-label set\nis then concatenated with the ground-truth labels to form a final augmented supervision set\nYt for taskt, which is used to optimise the modelΦ t using Eq. (3). 3 Methodology\n3.1 Problem Formulation\n3DIS.The objective of this task is to detect and segment each object instance within a point\ncloud. Formally, the training dataset is denoted asD={(P i,Yi)}N\ni=1, whereNis the number\nof training samples. Each inputP i ∈R M×6 is a coloured point cloud consisting ofMpoints,\nwhere each point is represented by its 3D coordinates and RGB values. The corresponding\nannotationY i ={(m i,j ,ci,j )}Ji\nj=1 containsJ i object instances, wheremi,j ∈ {0,1}M is a binary\nmask indicating which points belong to thej-th instance, andc i,j ∈ C={1,...,C}is the\nsemantic class label of that instance. GivenP i, the modelΦpredicts instance-level outputs\nˆYi ={(ˆmi,j ,ˆci,j )}\nˆJi\nj=1, where ˆmi,j and ˆci,j denote the predicted mask and category label for\nthej-th instance, respectively. The number of predicted instances ˆJi varies depending on the\nmodel’s inference. The model is optimised using the following objective:\nL3DIS(D;Φ) = 1\n|D| ∑\n(P,Y)∈D\n1\n|Y| ∑\n(mj,cj)∈Y\n(Lmask(mj,ˆmj)+λ·L cls(cj,ˆcj)),(1)\nwhereL cls andL mask are the average classification and mask losses over all instances, andλ\ncontrols their trade-off. CI-3DIS.Unlike conventional 3DIS, CI-3DIS involves sequential learning, where object\ncategories are introduced incrementally overTtraining tasks. Each tasktintroduces a dis-\njoint set of classesC t , withC= ST\nt=1 Ct andC t ∩C t′\n=/ 0 fort̸=t ′. During each taskt, the THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D5\nmodel receives a datasetD t ={(P i,Yt\ni)}N\ni=1, where each coloured point cloudP i ∈R M×6\ncontainsMpoints, and the corresponding annotationY t\ni ={(m t\ni,j ,ct\ni,j )}\nJt\ni\nj=1 includes instance\nmasksm t\ni,j ∈ {0,1}M and semantic class labelsc t\ni,j ∈ Ct . The modelΦ t , initialized from\nΦt−1 , is trained onD t to predict instance-level outputs ˆYt\ni ={(ˆmt\ni,j ,ˆct\ni,j )}\nˆJt\ni\nj=1, where each\npredicted semantic label ˆct\ni,j belongs to the cumulative set of all classes observed so far:St\nk=1 Ck. The key challenge in this setup is to learn new classes without forgetting those\nencountered in previous tasks, despite limited supervision and the absence of past labels. 3.2 Method: CLIMB-3D\nOverview.As shown in Fig. 2 and formulated in Sec. 3.1, the proposed framework for\nCI-3DIS follows aphase-wisetraining strategy. In each phase, the model is exposed to a\ncarefully curated subset of the dataset, simulating real-world scenarios discussed in Sec. 3.3. Training naïvely on such phased data leads tocatastrophic forgetting[51], where the model\nforgets prior knowledge when learning new tasks. To address this, we first incorporateEx-\nemplar Replay(ER) [5], a strategy inspired by 2D incremental methods [1, 43, 54] and\nrecently extended to 3D settings [4], to mitigate forgetting by storing a small set of repre-\nsentative samples from earlier phases. However, ER alone is insufficient to achieve robust\nperformance. To address this, two additional components are introduced: aPseudo-Label\nGenerator(PLG), which leverages a frozen model to generate supervision signals for previ-\nously seen classes, and aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) module that compensates for\nclass imbalance across phases. Each of these components is described in detail below 1. Exemplar Replay (ER).Inspired by Buzzega et al. [5], ER addresses the issue of catas-\ntrophic forgetting by allowing the model to retain a subset of data from earlier phases. During phaset, the model is trained not only on the current task dataD t , but also on a\nset of exemplarsE 1:t−1, collected from previous phases. These exemplars are accumulated\nincrementally:E 1:t−1 =E 1 ∪···∪E t−1 .Here,E t denotes the exemplar subset stored after\nphaset, and|E t |denotes the exemplar replay size. The combined replay dataset is denoted\nas:D t\nER =D t ∪E 1:t−1.Epoch training consists of two stages: first, the model is trained on\nthe current data,D t ; then it is trained using exemplars fromE 1:t−1. While previous CI-3DIS approaches rely on large exemplar sets to mitigate forgetting [4],\nsuch strategies become impractical under memory constraints. Consequently, although ER\naids knowledge retention, it is insufficient on its own for robust performance with a limited\nexemplar budget. Therefore, PLG and CBR are introduced to better preserve past represen-\ntations and enhance generalisation across phases. Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG).In the CI-3DIS setting, during phaset(wheret>1),\nalthough ground-truth labels for previously seen classes are unavailable, the model from the\nprevious phaseΦ t−1 , which preserves knowledge of past tasks, is retained. We use this\nmodel to generate pseudo-labels for previously seen classes, thereby providing approximate\nsupervision during training. This allows the current modelΦt , to retain prior knowledge and\nreduce forgetting, even without access to ground-truth annotations. Given a point cloud and label pair(P,Y t ), fromD t , the previous modelΦ t−1 , generates\npseudo-labels for the previously seen classes as ˆY1:t−1 =Φ t−1 (P), which we denote as ˜Yt\n1For clarity, modifications introduced by each component (ER, PLG, and CBR) are highlighted in green, blue,\nand red, respectively. 6THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D\nfor brevity. However, we observe that utilising all predictions fromΦt−1 introduces noisy or\nincorrect labels, which degrade overall performance. To mitigate this, we select the top-K\nmost confident instance predictions, denoted as ˜Yt\nK, and concatenate them with the ground-\ntruth labels of the current task to obtain the supervision set: ¯Yt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt\nK. Following this,\nthe loss is computed over both the current task’s ground-truth labels and the top-Kconfi-\ndent pseudo-labels from earlier phases, enabling the model to retain prior knowledge while\nadapting to new classes. Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR).While ER and PLG contribute to preserving prior\nknowledge, we observe that the model’s predictions are biased towards frequent classes,\nresulting in the forgetting of rare categories. This issue is further amplified by the top-K\npseudo-labels selected by PLG, which predominantly represent dominant classes in the data. To address this, we propose aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) scheme that compensates\nfor class imbalance using object frequency statistics. At taskt, only the current datasetD t\nand its label distributionp t (c)over classesc∈ Ct are available. Datasets and class distribu-\ntions from earlier tasks{D i,p i(c)}t−1\ni=1 are no longer accessible, which makes it challenging\nto directly account for class imbalance across all previously seen tasks. Therefore, we pro-\npose to leverage the pseudo-label predictions of the frozen modelΦ t−1 as a proxy for the\nclass distribution across previously learned categories. During each training iteration, the previous modelΦ t−1 is applied to the current inputP\nto generate pseudo-labels ˜Yt , from which we accumulate class-wise frequency statistics for\npreviously learned classes. LetC1:t = St\ni=1 Ci represent the union of all classes seen up to task\nt. At the end of each epoch, we compute the overall class frequencyf∈R |C1:t | by combining\nthe pseudo-label distribution ˜pt (c)derived from ˜Yt with the ground-truth label distribution\npt (c)from the current task. The resulting frequency vectorf= [f(c)] c∈C1:t is then used to\ncompute class-wise weightsw= [w(c)] c∈C1:t , which guide balanced pseudo-label selection\nand help the model focus on rare classes. In the next epoch, the modelΦ t−1 produces soft pseudo-label predictions ˜Yt (as de-\nscribed in PLG) , where each component ˜Yt [c]denotes the confidence score for classc∈\nC1:t−1. To promote balanced pseudo-label selection, class-wise re-weighting is applied using\nw(c) = 1\nf(c)+ε , whereεis a small constant for numerical stability. The adjusted predictions\nare computed by applying the class-wise weights as: ˜Yt,w [c] =w(c)· ˜Yt [c],∀c∈ C 1:t−1. Top-Kselection is then applied to both the original and the re-weighted scores, yielding\ntwo pseudo-label sets: ˜Yt\nK and ˜Yt,w\nK , respectively. The final augmented target set, Yt , is\nconstructed by concatenating the ground-truth labelsY t with both sets of pseudo-labels:\nYt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt\nK ∥ ˜Yt,w\nK .(2)\nAlthough the above re-weighting mitigates bias from prior tasks, it does not address class\nimbalance within the current taskt. To resolve this, the class-balanced weightsw c are ex-\ntended to incorporate statistics from both previously seen and current classes, i.e., overC 1:t\nrather than onlyC 1:t−1. The updated weights, denoted asw ′\nc, are used to re-weights both\npseudo-label selection and classification loss, ensuring balanced supervision across all seen\ncategories, including rare ones. This unified strategy reduces bias and enhances performance\nacross phases. The pseudo-code for constructing the supervision set in Eq. (2), which incor-\nporates both PLG and CBR components, is provided in Appendix A.

After every phase, the model must recognise both newly added\nand previously learned classes. For instance, in Task 2, categories such asPillow,Coffee\nTable, andSofa Chairare introduced, while the model is expected to retain recognition\nof earlier classes likeTable,Chair, andCouch. 3D instance segmentation (3DIS) is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves\nidentifying precise object boundaries and class labels in 3D space, with broad applications in\ngraphics, robotics, and augmented reality [4, 39]. Traditional 3DIS methods, including top-\ndown [28, 70, 78], bottom-up [26, 73], and transformer-based approaches [59], perform well\nunder the assumption that all classes are available and balanced during training. However,\nthis assumption does not hold in real-world environments, where new object classes emerge\nover time and exhibit natural imbalance. This gap motivates the need for Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) [17, 54], which sup-\nports learning new categories while retaining knowledge of previous ones [51]. While CIL\nhas seen success in 2D image tasks [1, 43, 54, 60], extensions to 3D point clouds remain\nlimited, often focusing on object-level classification [13, 18, 48]. Recent works on scene-\nlevel class-incremental 3DIS (CI-3DIS) [4] and class-incremental semantic segmentation\n(CI-3DSS) [74] show promise, but depend heavily on large exemplar [56] and overlook class\nimbalance, limiting their practicality. To address this, we proposeCLIMB-3D, a unified framework forCLass-incremental\nIMBalance-aware3DIS that jointly tackles catastrophic forgetting and class imbalance. The\nframework begins with Exemplar Replay (ER), storing a small number of samples from\npast classes for later replay. However, this alone does not yield promising results under the\nstrict memory constraints required in CI-3DIS. To address this, we introduce a Pseudo-Label\nGenerator (PLG), which uses a frozen model from previous task to generate supervision for\nearlier classes. However, we observed that PLG tends to favour frequent classes while ig-\nnoring under-represented ones. To mitigate this, we propose a Class-Balanced Re-weighting\n(CBR), which estimates class frequencies from the pseudo-labels to enhance the learning of\nrare classes without accessing past data. Together, these components form a practical and\neffective solution for real-world 3DIS. To evaluate CLIMB-3D, we designed three benchmark scenarios for CI-3DIS based on\nthe ScanNet200 dataset [57]. These scenarios simulate incremental learning setup under nat-\nural class imbalance, where new classes emerge based on (A) object frequency, (B) semantic\nsimilarity, or (C) random grouping. Additionally, for comparison with existing methods,\nwe evaluate our approach on CI-3DSS using the ScanNetV2 dataset [16]. Experimental re-\nsults show that our method significantly reduces forgetting and improves performance across\nboth frequent and rare categories, outperforming previous methods in both settings. Fig. 1\nillustrates the CI-3DIS setup. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D3\nIn summary, our contributions are: (i) a novel problem setting of imbalanced class-\nincremental 3DIS with an effective method to balance learning and mitigate forgetting; (ii)\nthree benchmarks modelling continual object emergence with natural imbalance; and (iii)\nstrong experimental results, achieving up to 16.76% mAP improvement over baselines. 2 Related Work\n3D Instance Segmentation.Various methods have been proposed for 3DIS. Grouping-\nbased approaches adopt a bottom-up pipeline that learns latent embeddings for point cluster-\ning [9, 21, 22, 29, 37, 44, 70, 78]. In contrast, proposal-based methods follow a top-down\nstrategy by detecting 3D boxes and segmenting objects within them [19, 26, 46, 73, 76]. Recently, transformer-based models [68] have also been applied to 3DIS and 3DSS [59, 64],\ninspired by advances in 2D vision [10, 11]. However, these approaches require full anno-\ntations for all classes and are not designed for progressive learning, where only new class\nannotations are available and previous data is inaccessible. Another line of work aims to re-\nduce annotation costs by proposing weakly supervised 3DIS methods based on sparse cues\n[12, 27, 72]. While effective with limited annotations, these methods assume a fixed set of\nclasses and are susceptible to catastrophic forgetting in incremental settings. Incremental Learning.Continual learning involves training models sequentially to miti-\ngate catastrophic forgetting. One common strategy is model regularisation, which constrains\nparameter updates using techniques such as elastic weight consolidation or knowledge dis-\ntillation [1, 24, 35, 43, 60]. Another approach is exemplar replay, where past data is stored\nor generated to rehearse older tasks while learning new ones [5, 7, 30, 54]. A third direc-\ntion involves dynamically expanding the model architecture or using modular sub-networks\nto accommodate new tasks without interfering with old ones [31, 42, 53, 58, 71, 79]. Re-\ncent efforts in class-incremental 3D segmentation [63, 74] have shown early promise but\noften rely on basic architectures and focus primarily on semantic segmentation. Other works\n[4, 36] explore continual learning in 3D settings, though they often depend on large memory\nbuffers. In contrast, our work introduces a tailored framework for 3D instance segmentation\nthat effectively transfers knowledge across tasks, even under class imbalance. Long-tailed Recognition.Imbalanced class distributions lead to poor recognition of rare\n(long-tail) classes. To address this, re-sampling methods balance the data via input [8, 20, 50,\n52, 61] or feature space [3, 14, 40], avoiding naïve under-/over-sampling. Loss re-weighting\noffers another direction, using class-based [6, 15, 23, 32, 33, 69] or per-example [45, 55, 62]\nadjustments to ensure fair contribution. Parameter regularisation improves generalisation\nthrough weight constraints [2], albeit requiring careful tuning. Other approaches leverage\ntransfer learning [77, 81], self-supervision [41, 75], or contrastive learning [34, 41, 82] to\nimprove rare-class representations. Long-tailed recognition is well-studied in 2D with large-\nscale datasets [15, 49, 67]; in 3D, ScanNet200 [16, 57] enables similar efforts. Prior 3D\nwork focused on re-weighting, re-sampling, and transfer learning [57], while regularisation\nremains underexplored. CeCo [80] balances class centres via auxiliary loss but overlooks\nsampling and augmentation. Lahoud et al. [38] propose adaptive classifier regularisation\nfor 3D segmentation, outperforming prior approaches without threshold tuning. However,\nneither method considers incremental learning. In contrast, we jointly address long-tail and\ncontinual 3D semantic segmentation. 4THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D\nFeature \nBackbone\nTransformer \nDecoder\nFeature \nBackbone\nTransformer \nDecoder\n(𝑷,𝒀𝑡)\nCurrent model (𝛷\n𝑡\n)\nPseudo Label Generator (PLG) \nSelection\n෨𝑌𝐾\n𝑡\nℒCI−3DIS\n෨𝑌𝐾\n𝑡,𝑤\nത𝑌𝐾\n𝑡\n෠𝑌𝑡\n(𝐷𝑡)\nCurrent Dataset \nExemplar \nReplay (ER)\n+\n~\nClass-Balanced  \nRe-weighting \n(CBR)\n1\n𝑓(𝑐)\nFigure 2: Overview ofCLIMB-3Dfor CI-3DIS.

During taskt, point cloudsPand their corresponding labelsY t are\nsampled from a combination of the current training datasetD t and Exemplar Replay (ER),\nwhich maintains a small memory of past examples. These are then passed to the current\nmodelΦ t to produce predicted labelsY t . The Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG) selects the\ntop-Kpredictions from the previous modelΦ t−1 . These pseudo-labels are then weighted\nbased on class frequencyf(c)using Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR), and the top-Kre-\nweighted labels are selected to form the balanced pseudo-label set ¯Yt . This pseudo-label set\nis then concatenated with the ground-truth labels to form a final augmented supervision set\nYt for taskt, which is used to optimise the modelΦ t using Eq. (3). 3 Methodology\n3.1 Problem Formulation\n3DIS.The objective of this task is to detect and segment each object instance within a point\ncloud. Formally, the training dataset is denoted asD={(P i,Yi)}N\ni=1, whereNis the number\nof training samples. Each inputP i ∈R M×6 is a coloured point cloud consisting ofMpoints,\nwhere each point is represented by its 3D coordinates and RGB values. The corresponding\nannotationY i ={(m i,j ,ci,j )}Ji\nj=1 containsJ i object instances, wheremi,j ∈ {0,1}M is a binary\nmask indicating which points belong to thej-th instance, andc i,j ∈ C={1,...,C}is the\nsemantic class label of that instance. GivenP i, the modelΦpredicts instance-level outputs\nˆYi ={(ˆmi,j ,ˆci,j )}\nˆJi\nj=1, where ˆmi,j and ˆci,j denote the predicted mask and category label for\nthej-th instance, respectively. The number of predicted instances ˆJi varies depending on the\nmodel’s inference. The model is optimised using the following objective:\nL3DIS(D;Φ) = 1\n|D| ∑\n(P,Y)∈D\n1\n|Y| ∑\n(mj,cj)∈Y\n(Lmask(mj,ˆmj)+λ·L cls(cj,ˆcj)),(1)\nwhereL cls andL mask are the average classification and mask losses over all instances, andλ\ncontrols their trade-off. CI-3DIS.Unlike conventional 3DIS, CI-3DIS involves sequential learning, where object\ncategories are introduced incrementally overTtraining tasks. Each tasktintroduces a dis-\njoint set of classesC t , withC= ST\nt=1 Ct andC t ∩C t′\n=/ 0 fort̸=t ′. During each taskt, the THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D5\nmodel receives a datasetD t ={(P i,Yt\ni)}N\ni=1, where each coloured point cloudP i ∈R M×6\ncontainsMpoints, and the corresponding annotationY t\ni ={(m t\ni,j ,ct\ni,j )}\nJt\ni\nj=1 includes instance\nmasksm t\ni,j ∈ {0,1}M and semantic class labelsc t\ni,j ∈ Ct . The modelΦ t , initialized from\nΦt−1 , is trained onD t to predict instance-level outputs ˆYt\ni ={(ˆmt\ni,j ,ˆct\ni,j )}\nˆJt\ni\nj=1, where each\npredicted semantic label ˆct\ni,j belongs to the cumulative set of all classes observed so far:St\nk=1 Ck. The key challenge in this setup is to learn new classes without forgetting those\nencountered in previous tasks, despite limited supervision and the absence of past labels. 3.2 Method: CLIMB-3D\nOverview.As shown in Fig. 2 and formulated in Sec. 3.1, the proposed framework for\nCI-3DIS follows aphase-wisetraining strategy. In each phase, the model is exposed to a\ncarefully curated subset of the dataset, simulating real-world scenarios discussed in Sec. 3.3. Training naïvely on such phased data leads tocatastrophic forgetting[51], where the model\nforgets prior knowledge when learning new tasks. To address this, we first incorporateEx-\nemplar Replay(ER) [5], a strategy inspired by 2D incremental methods [1, 43, 54] and\nrecently extended to 3D settings [4], to mitigate forgetting by storing a small set of repre-\nsentative samples from earlier phases. However, ER alone is insufficient to achieve robust\nperformance. To address this, two additional components are introduced: aPseudo-Label\nGenerator(PLG), which leverages a frozen model to generate supervision signals for previ-\nously seen classes, and aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) module that compensates for\nclass imbalance across phases. Each of these components is described in detail below 1. Exemplar Replay (ER).Inspired by Buzzega et al. [5], ER addresses the issue of catas-\ntrophic forgetting by allowing the model to retain a subset of data from earlier phases. During phaset, the model is trained not only on the current task dataD t , but also on a\nset of exemplarsE 1:t−1, collected from previous phases. These exemplars are accumulated\nincrementally:E 1:t−1 =E 1 ∪···∪E t−1 .Here,E t denotes the exemplar subset stored after\nphaset, and|E t |denotes the exemplar replay size. The combined replay dataset is denoted\nas:D t\nER =D t ∪E 1:t−1.Epoch training consists of two stages: first, the model is trained on\nthe current data,D t ; then it is trained using exemplars fromE 1:t−1. While previous CI-3DIS approaches rely on large exemplar sets to mitigate forgetting [4],\nsuch strategies become impractical under memory constraints. Consequently, although ER\naids knowledge retention, it is insufficient on its own for robust performance with a limited\nexemplar budget. Therefore, PLG and CBR are introduced to better preserve past represen-\ntations and enhance generalisation across phases. Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG).In the CI-3DIS setting, during phaset(wheret>1),\nalthough ground-truth labels for previously seen classes are unavailable, the model from the\nprevious phaseΦ t−1 , which preserves knowledge of past tasks, is retained. We use this\nmodel to generate pseudo-labels for previously seen classes, thereby providing approximate\nsupervision during training. This allows the current modelΦt , to retain prior knowledge and\nreduce forgetting, even without access to ground-truth annotations. Given a point cloud and label pair(P,Y t ), fromD t , the previous modelΦ t−1 , generates\npseudo-labels for the previously seen classes as ˆY1:t−1 =Φ t−1 (P), which we denote as ˜Yt\n1For clarity, modifications introduced by each component (ER, PLG, and CBR) are highlighted in green, blue,\nand red, respectively. 6THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D\nfor brevity. However, we observe that utilising all predictions fromΦt−1 introduces noisy or\nincorrect labels, which degrade overall performance. To mitigate this, we select the top-K\nmost confident instance predictions, denoted as ˜Yt\nK, and concatenate them with the ground-\ntruth labels of the current task to obtain the supervision set: ¯Yt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt\nK. Following this,\nthe loss is computed over both the current task’s ground-truth labels and the top-Kconfi-\ndent pseudo-labels from earlier phases, enabling the model to retain prior knowledge while\nadapting to new classes. Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR).While ER and PLG contribute to preserving prior\nknowledge, we observe that the model’s predictions are biased towards frequent classes,\nresulting in the forgetting of rare categories. This issue is further amplified by the top-K\npseudo-labels selected by PLG, which predominantly represent dominant classes in the data. To address this, we propose aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) scheme that compensates\nfor class imbalance using object frequency statistics. At taskt, only the current datasetD t\nand its label distributionp t (c)over classesc∈ Ct are available. Datasets and class distribu-\ntions from earlier tasks{D i,p i(c)}t−1\ni=1 are no longer accessible, which makes it challenging\nto directly account for class imbalance across all previously seen tasks. Therefore, we pro-\npose to leverage the pseudo-label predictions of the frozen modelΦ t−1 as a proxy for the\nclass distribution across previously learned categories. During each training iteration, the previous modelΦ t−1 is applied to the current inputP\nto generate pseudo-labels ˜Yt , from which we accumulate class-wise frequency statistics for\npreviously learned classes. LetC1:t = St\ni=1 Ci represent the union of all classes seen up to task\nt. At the end of each epoch, we compute the overall class frequencyf∈R |C1:t | by combining\nthe pseudo-label distribution ˜pt (c)derived from ˜Yt with the ground-truth label distribution\npt (c)from the current task. The resulting frequency vectorf= [f(c)] c∈C1:t is then used to\ncompute class-wise weightsw= [w(c)] c∈C1:t , which guide balanced pseudo-label selection\nand help the model focus on rare classes. In the next epoch, the modelΦ t−1 produces soft pseudo-label predictions ˜Yt (as de-\nscribed in PLG) , where each component ˜Yt [c]denotes the confidence score for classc∈\nC1:t−1. To promote balanced pseudo-label selection, class-wise re-weighting is applied using\nw(c) = 1\nf(c)+ε , whereεis a small constant for numerical stability. The adjusted predictions\nare computed by applying the class-wise weights as: ˜Yt,w [c] =w(c)· ˜Yt [c],∀c∈ C 1:t−1. Top-Kselection is then applied to both the original and the re-weighted scores, yielding\ntwo pseudo-label sets: ˜Yt\nK and ˜Yt,w\nK , respectively. The final augmented target set, Yt , is\nconstructed by concatenating the ground-truth labelsY t with both sets of pseudo-labels:\nYt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt\nK ∥ ˜Yt,w\nK .(2)\nAlthough the above re-weighting mitigates bias from prior tasks, it does not address class\nimbalance within the current taskt. To resolve this, the class-balanced weightsw c are ex-\ntended to incorporate statistics from both previously seen and current classes, i.e., overC 1:t\nrather than onlyC 1:t−1. The updated weights, denoted asw ′\nc, are used to re-weights both\npseudo-label selection and classification loss, ensuring balanced supervision across all seen\ncategories, including rare ones. This unified strategy reduces bias and enhances performance\nacross phases. The pseudo-code for constructing the supervision set in Eq. (2), which incor-\nporates both PLG and CBR components, is provided in Appendix A.

Overall, our proposed\nmethod improves mAP by 5.6%. In this supplementary material, we first demonstrate the performance gains on rare classes\nachieved by incorporating the IC module in Appendix C. Next, we provide detailed split in-\nformation for all scenarios, based on class names, in Appendix D. Finally, we present a qual-\nitative comparison between the baseline method and our proposed approach in Appendix\nE. Appendix C Evaluation on Rare Categories\nThe proposed imbalance correction (IC) module, as detailed in Section 4.2, is designed to\naddress the performance gap for rare classes. To assess its impact, we compare its perfor-\nmance with the framework which has exemplar replay (ER) and knowledge distillation (KD). Specifically, we focus on its ability to improve performance for rare classes, which the model\nencounters infrequently compared to more common classes. The results, shown in Tab.\n\n5 and Tab. 6, correspond to evaluations onSplit-AforPhase\n2andPhase 3, respectively. InPhase 2, we evaluate classes seen 1–20 times per epoch,\nwhilePhase 3targets even less frequent classes, with observations limited to 1–10 times per\nepoch. As illustrated in Tab. 5, the IC module substantially improves performance on rare\nclasses in terms of mAP 50 in Phase 2 ofSplit-A. For instance, classes likerecycling\nbinandtrash bin, seen only 3 and 7 times, respectively, shows significant improvement\nwhen the IC module is applied. Overall, the IC module provides an average boost of 8.32%,\nhighlighting its effectiveness in mitigating class imbalance. Similarly, Tab. 6 presents results forPhase 3, demonstrating significant gains for infre-\nquent classes. For example, even though the classes such aspiano,bucket, andlaundry\nbasketare observed only once, IC module improves the performance by 52.30%, 10.40%,\nand 13.60%, respectively. The ER+KD module does not focus on rare classes likeshower\nandtoasterwhich results in low performance, but the IC module compensates for this imbal-\nance by focusing on underrepresented categories.

Fig. 4 illustrates the results on theSplit-Aevaluation after learning all\ntasks, comparing the performance of the baseline method and our proposed approach.

After every phase, the model must recognise both newly added\nand previously learned classes. For instance, in Task 2, categories such asPillow,Coffee\nTable, andSofa Chairare introduced, while the model is expected to retain recognition\nof earlier classes likeTable,Chair, andCouch. 3D instance segmentation (3DIS) is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves\nidentifying precise object boundaries and class labels in 3D space, with broad applications in\ngraphics, robotics, and augmented reality [4, 39]. Traditional 3DIS methods, including top-\ndown [28, 70, 78], bottom-up [26, 73], and transformer-based approaches [59], perform well\nunder the assumption that all classes are available and balanced during training. However,\nthis assumption does not hold in real-world environments, where new object classes emerge\nover time and exhibit natural imbalance. This gap motivates the need for Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) [17, 54], which sup-\nports learning new categories while retaining knowledge of previous ones [51]. While CIL\nhas seen success in 2D image tasks [1, 43, 54, 60], extensions to 3D point clouds remain\nlimited, often focusing on object-level classification [13, 18, 48]. Recent works on scene-\nlevel class-incremental 3DIS (CI-3DIS) [4] and class-incremental semantic segmentation\n(CI-3DSS) [74] show promise, but depend heavily on large exemplar [56] and overlook class\nimbalance, limiting their practicality. To address this, we proposeCLIMB-3D, a unified framework forCLass-incremental\nIMBalance-aware3DIS that jointly tackles catastrophic forgetting and class imbalance. The\nframework begins with Exemplar Replay (ER), storing a small number of samples from\npast classes for later replay. However, this alone does not yield promising results under the\nstrict memory constraints required in CI-3DIS. To address this, we introduce a Pseudo-Label\nGenerator (PLG), which uses a frozen model from previous task to generate supervision for\nearlier classes. However, we observed that PLG tends to favour frequent classes while ig-\nnoring under-represented ones. To mitigate this, we propose a Class-Balanced Re-weighting\n(CBR), which estimates class frequencies from the pseudo-labels to enhance the learning of\nrare classes without accessing past data. Together, these components form a practical and\neffective solution for real-world 3DIS. To evaluate CLIMB-3D, we designed three benchmark scenarios for CI-3DIS based on\nthe ScanNet200 dataset [57]. These scenarios simulate incremental learning setup under nat-\nural class imbalance, where new classes emerge based on (A) object frequency, (B) semantic\nsimilarity, or (C) random grouping. Additionally, for comparison with existing methods,\nwe evaluate our approach on CI-3DSS using the ScanNetV2 dataset [16]. Experimental re-\nsults show that our method significantly reduces forgetting and improves performance across\nboth frequent and rare categories, outperforming previous methods in both settings. Fig. 1\nillustrates the CI-3DIS setup. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D3\nIn summary, our contributions are: (i) a novel problem setting of imbalanced class-\nincremental 3DIS with an effective method to balance learning and mitigate forgetting; (ii)\nthree benchmarks modelling continual object emergence with natural imbalance; and (iii)\nstrong experimental results, achieving up to 16.76% mAP improvement over baselines. 2 Related Work\n3D Instance Segmentation.Various methods have been proposed for 3DIS. Grouping-\nbased approaches adopt a bottom-up pipeline that learns latent embeddings for point cluster-\ning [9, 21, 22, 29, 37, 44, 70, 78]. In contrast, proposal-based methods follow a top-down\nstrategy by detecting 3D boxes and segmenting objects within them [19, 26, 46, 73, 76]. Recently, transformer-based models [68] have also been applied to 3DIS and 3DSS [59, 64],\ninspired by advances in 2D vision [10, 11]. However, these approaches require full anno-\ntations for all classes and are not designed for progressive learning, where only new class\nannotations are available and previous data is inaccessible. Another line of work aims to re-\nduce annotation costs by proposing weakly supervised 3DIS methods based on sparse cues\n[12, 27, 72]. While effective with limited annotations, these methods assume a fixed set of\nclasses and are susceptible to catastrophic forgetting in incremental settings. Incremental Learning.Continual learning involves training models sequentially to miti-\ngate catastrophic forgetting. One common strategy is model regularisation, which constrains\nparameter updates using techniques such as elastic weight consolidation or knowledge dis-\ntillation [1, 24, 35, 43, 60]. Another approach is exemplar replay, where past data is stored\nor generated to rehearse older tasks while learning new ones [5, 7, 30, 54]. A third direc-\ntion involves dynamically expanding the model architecture or using modular sub-networks\nto accommodate new tasks without interfering with old ones [31, 42, 53, 58, 71, 79]. Re-\ncent efforts in class-incremental 3D segmentation [63, 74] have shown early promise but\noften rely on basic architectures and focus primarily on semantic segmentation. Other works\n[4, 36] explore continual learning in 3D settings, though they often depend on large memory\nbuffers. In contrast, our work introduces a tailored framework for 3D instance segmentation\nthat effectively transfers knowledge across tasks, even under class imbalance. Long-tailed Recognition.Imbalanced class distributions lead to poor recognition of rare\n(long-tail) classes. To address this, re-sampling methods balance the data via input [8, 20, 50,\n52, 61] or feature space [3, 14, 40], avoiding naïve under-/over-sampling. Loss re-weighting\noffers another direction, using class-based [6, 15, 23, 32, 33, 69] or per-example [45, 55, 62]\nadjustments to ensure fair contribution. Parameter regularisation improves generalisation\nthrough weight constraints [2], albeit requiring careful tuning. Other approaches leverage\ntransfer learning [77, 81], self-supervision [41, 75], or contrastive learning [34, 41, 82] to\nimprove rare-class representations. Long-tailed recognition is well-studied in 2D with large-\nscale datasets [15, 49, 67]; in 3D, ScanNet200 [16, 57] enables similar efforts. Prior 3D\nwork focused on re-weighting, re-sampling, and transfer learning [57], while regularisation\nremains underexplored. CeCo [80] balances class centres via auxiliary loss but overlooks\nsampling and augmentation. Lahoud et al. [38] propose adaptive classifier regularisation\nfor 3D segmentation, outperforming prior approaches without threshold tuning. However,\nneither method considers incremental learning. In contrast, we jointly address long-tail and\ncontinual 3D semantic segmentation. 4THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D\nFeature \nBackbone\nTransformer \nDecoder\nFeature \nBackbone\nTransformer \nDecoder\n(𝑷,𝒀𝑡)\nCurrent model (𝛷\n𝑡\n)\nPseudo Label Generator (PLG) \nSelection\n෨𝑌𝐾\n𝑡\nℒCI−3DIS\n෨𝑌𝐾\n𝑡,𝑤\nത𝑌𝐾\n𝑡\n෠𝑌𝑡\n(𝐷𝑡)\nCurrent Dataset \nExemplar \nReplay (ER)\n+\n~\nClass-Balanced  \nRe-weighting \n(CBR)\n1\n𝑓(𝑐)\nFigure 2: Overview ofCLIMB-3Dfor CI-3DIS. The model incrementally learns new classes\nacross sequential phases. During taskt, point cloudsPand their corresponding labelsY t are\nsampled from a combination of the current training datasetD t and Exemplar Replay (ER),\nwhich maintains a small memory of past examples. These are then passed to the current\nmodelΦ t to produce predicted labelsY t . The Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG) selects the\ntop-Kpredictions from the previous modelΦ t−1 . These pseudo-labels are then weighted\nbased on class frequencyf(c)using Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR), and the top-Kre-\nweighted labels are selected to form the balanced pseudo-label set ¯Yt . This pseudo-label set\nis then concatenated with the ground-truth labels to form a final augmented supervision set\nYt for taskt, which is used to optimise the modelΦ t using Eq. (3). 3 Methodology\n3.1 Problem Formulation\n3DIS.The objective of this task is to detect and segment each object instance within a point\ncloud. Formally, the training dataset is denoted asD={(P i,Yi)}N\ni=1, whereNis the number\nof training samples. Each inputP i ∈R M×6 is a coloured point cloud consisting ofMpoints,\nwhere each point is represented by its 3D coordinates and RGB values. The corresponding\nannotationY i ={(m i,j ,ci,j )}Ji\nj=1 containsJ i object instances, wheremi,j ∈ {0,1}M is a binary\nmask indicating which points belong to thej-th instance, andc i,j ∈ C={1,...,C}is the\nsemantic class label of that instance. GivenP i, the modelΦpredicts instance-level outputs\nˆYi ={(ˆmi,j ,ˆci,j )}\nˆJi\nj=1, where ˆmi,j and ˆci,j denote the predicted mask and category label for\nthej-th instance, respectively. The number of predicted instances ˆJi varies depending on the\nmodel’s inference. The model is optimised using the following objective:\nL3DIS(D;Φ) = 1\n|D| ∑\n(P,Y)∈D\n1\n|Y| ∑\n(mj,cj)∈Y\n(Lmask(mj,ˆmj)+λ·L cls(cj,ˆcj)),(1)\nwhereL cls andL mask are the average classification and mask losses over all instances, andλ\ncontrols their trade-off. CI-3DIS.Unlike conventional 3DIS, CI-3DIS involves sequential learning, where object\ncategories are introduced incrementally overTtraining tasks. Each tasktintroduces a dis-\njoint set of classesC t , withC= ST\nt=1 Ct andC t ∩C t′\n=/ 0 fort̸=t ′. During each taskt, the THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D5\nmodel receives a datasetD t ={(P i,Yt\ni)}N\ni=1, where each coloured point cloudP i ∈R M×6\ncontainsMpoints, and the corresponding annotationY t\ni ={(m t\ni,j ,ct\ni,j )}\nJt\ni\nj=1 includes instance\nmasksm t\ni,j ∈ {0,1}M and semantic class labelsc t\ni,j ∈ Ct . The modelΦ t , initialized from\nΦt−1 , is trained onD t to predict instance-level outputs ˆYt\ni ={(ˆmt\ni,j ,ˆct\ni,j )}\nˆJt\ni\nj=1, where each\npredicted semantic label ˆct\ni,j belongs to the cumulative set of all classes observed so far:St\nk=1 Ck. The key challenge in this setup is to learn new classes without forgetting those\nencountered in previous tasks, despite limited supervision and the absence of past labels. 3.2 Method: CLIMB-3D\nOverview.As shown in Fig. 2 and formulated in Sec. 3.1, the proposed framework for\nCI-3DIS follows aphase-wisetraining strategy. In each phase, the model is exposed to a\ncarefully curated subset of the dataset, simulating real-world scenarios discussed in Sec. 3.3. Training naïvely on such phased data leads tocatastrophic forgetting[51], where the model\nforgets prior knowledge when learning new tasks. To address this, we first incorporateEx-\nemplar Replay(ER) [5], a strategy inspired by 2D incremental methods [1, 43, 54] and\nrecently extended to 3D settings [4], to mitigate forgetting by storing a small set of repre-\nsentative samples from earlier phases. However, ER alone is insufficient to achieve robust\nperformance. To address this, two additional components are introduced: aPseudo-Label\nGenerator(PLG), which leverages a frozen model to generate supervision signals for previ-\nously seen classes, and aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) module that compensates for\nclass imbalance across phases. Each of these components is described in detail below 1. Exemplar Replay (ER).Inspired by Buzzega et al. [5], ER addresses the issue of catas-\ntrophic forgetting by allowing the model to retain a subset of data from earlier phases. During phaset, the model is trained not only on the current task dataD t , but also on a\nset of exemplarsE 1:t−1, collected from previous phases. These exemplars are accumulated\nincrementally:E 1:t−1 =E 1 ∪···∪E t−1 .Here,E t denotes the exemplar subset stored after\nphaset, and|E t |denotes the exemplar replay size. The combined replay dataset is denoted\nas:D t\nER =D t ∪E 1:t−1.Epoch training consists of two stages: first, the model is trained on\nthe current data,D t ; then it is trained using exemplars fromE 1:t−1. While previous CI-3DIS approaches rely on large exemplar sets to mitigate forgetting [4],\nsuch strategies become impractical under memory constraints. Consequently, although ER\naids knowledge retention, it is insufficient on its own for robust performance with a limited\nexemplar budget. Therefore, PLG and CBR are introduced to better preserve past represen-\ntations and enhance generalisation across phases. Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG).In the CI-3DIS setting, during phaset(wheret>1),\nalthough ground-truth labels for previously seen classes are unavailable, the model from the\nprevious phaseΦ t−1 , which preserves knowledge of past tasks, is retained. We use this\nmodel to generate pseudo-labels for previously seen classes, thereby providing approximate\nsupervision during training. This allows the current modelΦt , to retain prior knowledge and\nreduce forgetting, even without access to ground-truth annotations. Given a point cloud and label pair(P,Y t ), fromD t , the previous modelΦ t−1 , generates\npseudo-labels for the previously seen classes as ˆY1:t−1 =Φ t−1 (P), which we denote as ˜Yt\n1For clarity, modifications introduced by each component (ER, PLG, and CBR) are highlighted in green, blue,\nand red, respectively. 6THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D\nfor brevity. However, we observe that utilising all predictions fromΦt−1 introduces noisy or\nincorrect labels, which degrade overall performance. To mitigate this, we select the top-K\nmost confident instance predictions, denoted as ˜Yt\nK, and concatenate them with the ground-\ntruth labels of the current task to obtain the supervision set: ¯Yt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt\nK. Following this,\nthe loss is computed over both the current task’s ground-truth labels and the top-Kconfi-\ndent pseudo-labels from earlier phases, enabling the model to retain prior knowledge while\nadapting to new classes. Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR).While ER and PLG contribute to preserving prior\nknowledge, we observe that the model’s predictions are biased towards frequent classes,\nresulting in the forgetting of rare categories. This issue is further amplified by the top-K\npseudo-labels selected by PLG, which predominantly represent dominant classes in the data. To address this, we propose aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) scheme that compensates\nfor class imbalance using object frequency statistics. At taskt, only the current datasetD t\nand its label distributionp t (c)over classesc∈ Ct are available. Datasets and class distribu-\ntions from earlier tasks{D i,p i(c)}t−1\ni=1 are no longer accessible, which makes it challenging\nto directly account for class imbalance across all previously seen tasks. Therefore, we pro-\npose to leverage the pseudo-label predictions of the frozen modelΦ t−1 as a proxy for the\nclass distribution across previously learned categories. During each training iteration, the previous modelΦ t−1 is applied to the current inputP\nto generate pseudo-labels ˜Yt , from which we accumulate class-wise frequency statistics for\npreviously learned classes. LetC1:t = St\ni=1 Ci represent the union of all classes seen up to task\nt. At the end of each epoch, we compute the overall class frequencyf∈R |C1:t | by combining\nthe pseudo-label distribution ˜pt (c)derived from ˜Yt with the ground-truth label distribution\npt (c)from the current task. The resulting frequency vectorf= [f(c)] c∈C1:t is then used to\ncompute class-wise weightsw= [w(c)] c∈C1:t , which guide balanced pseudo-label selection\nand help the model focus on rare classes. In the next epoch, the modelΦ t−1 produces soft pseudo-label predictions ˜Yt (as de-\nscribed in PLG) , where each component ˜Yt [c]denotes the confidence score for classc∈\nC1:t−1. To promote balanced pseudo-label selection, class-wise re-weighting is applied using\nw(c) = 1\nf(c)+ε , whereεis a small constant for numerical stability. The adjusted predictions\nare computed by applying the class-wise weights as: ˜Yt,w [c] =w(c)· ˜Yt [c],∀c∈ C 1:t−1. Top-Kselection is then applied to both the original and the re-weighted scores, yielding\ntwo pseudo-label sets: ˜Yt\nK and ˜Yt,w\nK , respectively. The final augmented target set, Yt , is\nconstructed by concatenating the ground-truth labelsY t with both sets of pseudo-labels:\nYt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt\nK ∥ ˜Yt,w\nK .(2)\nAlthough the above re-weighting mitigates bias from prior tasks, it does not address class\nimbalance within the current taskt. To resolve this, the class-balanced weightsw c are ex-\ntended to incorporate statistics from both previously seen and current classes, i.e., overC 1:t\nrather than onlyC 1:t−1. The updated weights, denoted asw ′\nc, are used to re-weights both\npseudo-label selection and classification loss, ensuring balanced supervision across all seen\ncategories, including rare ones. This unified strategy reduces bias and enhances performance\nacross phases. The pseudo-code for constructing the supervision set in Eq.

Next, we provide detailed split in-\nformation for all scenarios, based on class names, in Appendix D. Finally, we present a qual-\nitative comparison between the baseline method and our proposed approach in Appendix\nE. Appendix C Evaluation on Rare Categories\nThe proposed imbalance correction (IC) module, as detailed in Section 4.2, is designed to\naddress the performance gap for rare classes. To assess its impact, we compare its perfor-\nmance with the framework which has exemplar replay (ER) and knowledge distillation (KD). Specifically, we focus on its ability to improve performance for rare classes, which the model\nencounters infrequently compared to more common classes. The results, shown in Tab.\n\nAs illustrated in Tab. 5, the IC module substantially improves performance on rare classes in terms of mAP 50 in Phase 2 of Split-A. For instance, classes like recycling bin and trash bin, seen only 3 and 7 times, respectively, shows significant improvement when the IC module is applied. Overall, the IC module provides an average boost of 8.32%, highlighting its effectiveness in mitigating class imbalance.\n\n5 and Tab. 6, correspond to evaluations onSplit-AforPhase\n2andPhase 3, respectively. InPhase 2, we evaluate classes seen 1–20 times per epoch,\nwhilePhase 3targets even less frequent classes, with observations limited to 1–10 times per\nepoch. As illustrated in Tab. 5, the IC module substantially improves performance on rare\nclasses in terms of mAP 50 in Phase 2 ofSplit-A. For instance, classes likerecycling\nbinandtrash bin, seen only 3 and 7 times, respectively, shows significant improvement\nwhen the IC module is applied. Overall, the IC module provides an average boost of 8.32%,\nhighlighting its effectiveness in mitigating class imbalance. Similarly, Tab. 6 presents results forPhase 3, demonstrating significant gains for infre-\nquent classes. For example, even though the classes such aspiano,bucket, andlaundry\nbasketare observed only once, IC module improves the performance by 52.30%, 10.40%,\nand 13.60%, respectively.

However, this assumption is unrealistic in dynamic, real-world environments where new\nclasses emerge gradually and exhibit natural imbalance. Although some approaches ad-\ndress the emergence of new classes, they often overlook class imbalance, which leads\nto suboptimal performance, particularly on rare categories. To tackle this, we propose\nCLIMB-3D, a unified framework forCLass-incrementalImbalance-aware3DIS. Build-\ning upon established exemplar replay (ER) strategies, we show that ER alone is insuf-\nficient to achieve robust performance under memory constraints. To mitigate this, we\nintroduce a novel pseudo-label generator (PLG) that extends supervision to previously\nlearned categories by leveraging predictions from a frozen model trained on prior tasks. Despite its promise, PLG tends to be biased towards frequent classes. Therefore, we\npropose a class-balanced re-weighting (CBR) scheme that estimates object frequencies\nfrom pseudo-labels and dynamically adjusts training bias, without requiring access to\npast data. We design and evaluate three incremental scenarios for 3DIS on the challeng-\ning ScanNet200 dataset and additionally validate our method for semantic segmentation\non ScanNetV2. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing prior work by\nup to 16.76% mAP for instance segmentation and approximately 30% mIoU for semantic\nsegmentation, demonstrating strong generalisation across both frequent and rare classes.

After every phase, the model must recognise both newly added\nand previously learned classes. For instance, in Task 2, categories such asPillow,Coffee\nTable, andSofa Chairare introduced, while the model is expected to retain recognition\nof earlier classes likeTable,Chair, andCouch. 3D instance segmentation (3DIS) is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves\nidentifying precise object boundaries and class labels in 3D space, with broad applications in\ngraphics, robotics, and augmented reality [4, 39]. Traditional 3DIS methods, including top-\ndown [28, 70, 78], bottom-up [26, 73], and transformer-based approaches [59], perform well\nunder the assumption that all classes are available and balanced during training. However,\nthis assumption does not hold in real-world environments, where new object classes emerge\nover time and exhibit natural imbalance. This gap motivates the need for Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) [17, 54], which sup-\nports learning new categories while retaining knowledge of previous ones [51]. While CIL\nhas seen success in 2D image tasks [1, 43, 54, 60], extensions to 3D point clouds remain\nlimited, often focusing on object-level classification [13, 18, 48]. Recent works on scene-\nlevel class-incremental 3DIS (CI-3DIS) [4] and class-incremental semantic segmentation\n(CI-3DSS) [74] show promise, but depend heavily on large exemplar [56] and overlook class\nimbalance, limiting their practicality. To address this, we proposeCLIMB-3D, a unified framework forCLass-incremental\nIMBalance-aware3DIS that jointly tackles catastrophic forgetting and class imbalance. The\nframework begins with Exemplar Replay (ER), storing a small number of samples from\npast classes for later replay. However, this alone does not yield promising results under the\nstrict memory constraints required in CI-3DIS. To address this, we introduce a Pseudo-Label\nGenerator (PLG), which uses a frozen model from previous task to generate supervision for\nearlier classes. However, we observed that PLG tends to favour frequent classes while ig-\nnoring under-represented ones. To mitigate this, we propose a Class-Balanced Re-weighting\n(CBR), which estimates class frequencies from the pseudo-labels to enhance the learning of\nrare classes without accessing past data. Together, these components form a practical and\neffective solution for real-world 3DIS. To evaluate CLIMB-3D, we designed three benchmark scenarios for CI-3DIS based on\nthe ScanNet200 dataset [57]. These scenarios simulate incremental learning setup under nat-\nural class imbalance, where new classes emerge based on (A) object frequency, (B) semantic\nsimilarity, or (C) random grouping. Additionally, for comparison with existing methods,\nwe evaluate our approach on CI-3DSS using the ScanNetV2 dataset [16]. Experimental re-\nsults show that our method significantly reduces forgetting and improves performance across\nboth frequent and rare categories, outperforming previous methods in both settings. Fig. 1\nillustrates the CI-3DIS setup. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D3\nIn summary, our contributions are: (i) a novel problem setting of imbalanced class-\nincremental 3DIS with an effective method to balance learning and mitigate forgetting; (ii)\nthree benchmarks modelling continual object emergence with natural imbalance; and (iii)\nstrong experimental results, achieving up to 16.76% mAP improvement over baselines. 2 Related Work\n3D Instance Segmentation.Various methods have been proposed for 3DIS. Grouping-\nbased approaches adopt a bottom-up pipeline that learns latent embeddings for point cluster-\ning [9, 21, 22, 29, 37, 44, 70, 78]. In contrast, proposal-based methods follow a top-down\nstrategy by detecting 3D boxes and segmenting objects within them [19, 26, 46, 73, 76]. Recently, transformer-based models [68] have also been applied to 3DIS and 3DSS [59, 64],\ninspired by advances in 2D vision [10, 11]. However, these approaches require full anno-\ntations for all classes and are not designed for progressive learning, where only new class\nannotations are available and previous data is inaccessible. Another line of work aims to re-\nduce annotation costs by proposing weakly supervised 3DIS methods based on sparse cues\n[12, 27, 72]. While effective with limited annotations, these methods assume a fixed set of\nclasses and are susceptible to catastrophic forgetting in incremental settings. Incremental Learning.Continual learning involves training models sequentially to miti-\ngate catastrophic forgetting. One common strategy is model regularisation, which constrains\nparameter updates using techniques such as elastic weight consolidation or knowledge dis-\ntillation [1, 24, 35, 43, 60]. Another approach is exemplar replay, where past data is stored\nor generated to rehearse older tasks while learning new ones [5, 7, 30, 54]. A third direc-\ntion involves dynamically expanding the model architecture or using modular sub-networks\nto accommodate new tasks without interfering with old ones [31, 42, 53, 58, 71, 79]. Re-\ncent efforts in class-incremental 3D segmentation [63, 74] have shown early promise but\noften rely on basic architectures and focus primarily on semantic segmentation. Other works\n[4, 36] explore continual learning in 3D settings, though they often depend on large memory\nbuffers. In contrast, our work introduces a tailored framework for 3D instance segmentation\nthat effectively transfers knowledge across tasks, even under class imbalance. Long-tailed Recognition.Imbalanced class distributions lead to poor recognition of rare\n(long-tail) classes. To address this, re-sampling methods balance the data via input [8, 20, 50,\n52, 61] or feature space [3, 14, 40], avoiding naïve under-/over-sampling. Loss re-weighting\noffers another direction, using class-based [6, 15, 23, 32, 33, 69] or per-example [45, 55, 62]\nadjustments to ensure fair contribution. Parameter regularisation improves generalisation\nthrough weight constraints [2], albeit requiring careful tuning. Other approaches leverage\ntransfer learning [77, 81], self-supervision [41, 75], or contrastive learning [34, 41, 82] to\nimprove rare-class representations. Long-tailed recognition is well-studied in 2D with large-\nscale datasets [15, 49, 67]; in 3D, ScanNet200 [16, 57] enables similar efforts. Prior 3D\nwork focused on re-weighting, re-sampling, and transfer learning [57], while regularisation\nremains underexplored. CeCo [80] balances class centres via auxiliary loss but overlooks\nsampling and augmentation. Lahoud et al. [38] propose adaptive classifier regularisation\nfor 3D segmentation, outperforming prior approaches without threshold tuning. However,\nneither method considers incremental learning. In contrast, we jointly address long-tail and\ncontinual 3D semantic segmentation. 4THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D\nFeature \nBackbone\nTransformer \nDecoder\nFeature \nBackbone\nTransformer \nDecoder\n(𝑷,𝒀𝑡)\nCurrent model (𝛷\n𝑡\n)\nPseudo Label Generator (PLG) \nSelection\n෨𝑌𝐾\n𝑡\nℒCI−3DIS\n෨𝑌𝐾\n𝑡,𝑤\nത𝑌𝐾\n𝑡\n෠𝑌𝑡\n(𝐷𝑡)\nCurrent Dataset \nExemplar \nReplay (ER)\n+\n~\nClass-Balanced  \nRe-weighting \n(CBR)\n1\n𝑓(𝑐)\nFigure 2: Overview ofCLIMB-3Dfor CI-3DIS.

These pseudo-labels are then weighted\nbased on class frequencyf(c)using Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR), and the top-Kre-\nweighted labels are selected to form the balanced pseudo-label set ¯Yt . This pseudo-label set\nis then concatenated with the ground-truth labels to form a final augmented supervision set\nYt for taskt, which is used to optimise the modelΦ t using Eq. (3). 3 Methodology\n3.1 Problem Formulation\n3DIS.The objective of this task is to detect and segment each object instance within a point\ncloud. Formally, the training dataset is denoted asD={(P i,Yi)}N\ni=1, whereNis the number\nof training samples. Each inputP i ∈R M×6 is a coloured point cloud consisting ofMpoints,\nwhere each point is represented by its 3D coordinates and RGB values. The corresponding\nannotationY i ={(m i,j ,ci,j )}Ji\nj=1 containsJ i object instances, wheremi,j ∈ {0,1}M is a binary\nmask indicating which points belong to thej-th instance, andc i,j ∈ C={1,...,C}is the\nsemantic class label of that instance. GivenP i, the modelΦpredicts instance-level outputs\nˆYi ={(ˆmi,j ,ˆci,j )}\nˆJi\nj=1, where ˆmi,j and ˆci,j denote the predicted mask and category label for\nthej-th instance, respectively. The number of predicted instances ˆJi varies depending on the\nmodel’s inference. The model is optimised using the following objective:\nL3DIS(D;Φ) = 1\n|D| ∑\n(P,Y)∈D\n1\n|Y| ∑\n(mj,cj)∈Y\n(Lmask(mj,ˆmj)+λ·L cls(cj,ˆcj)),(1)\nwhereL cls andL mask are the average classification and mask losses over all instances, andλ\ncontrols their trade-off. CI-3DIS.Unlike conventional 3DIS, CI-3DIS involves sequential learning, where object\ncategories are introduced incrementally overTtraining tasks. Each tasktintroduces a dis-\njoint set of classesC t , withC= ST\nt=1 Ct andC t ∩C t′\n=/ 0 fort̸=t ′. During each taskt, the THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D5\nmodel receives a datasetD t ={(P i,Yt\ni)}N\ni=1, where each coloured point cloudP i ∈R M×6\ncontainsMpoints, and the corresponding annotationY t\ni ={(m t\ni,j ,ct\ni,j )}\nJt\ni\nj=1 includes instance\nmasksm t\ni,j ∈ {0,1}M and semantic class labelsc t\ni,j ∈ Ct . The modelΦ t , initialized from\nΦt−1 , is trained onD t to predict instance-level outputs ˆYt\ni ={(ˆmt\ni,j ,ˆct\ni,j )}\nˆJt\ni\nj=1, where each\npredicted semantic label ˆct\ni,j belongs to the cumulative set of all classes observed so far:St\nk=1 Ck. The key challenge in this setup is to learn new classes without forgetting those\nencountered in previous tasks, despite limited supervision and the absence of past labels. 3.2 Method: CLIMB-3D\nOverview.As shown in Fig. 2 and formulated in Sec. 3.1, the proposed framework for\nCI-3DIS follows aphase-wisetraining strategy. In each phase, the model is exposed to a\ncarefully curated subset of the dataset, simulating real-world scenarios discussed in Sec. 3.3. Training naïvely on such phased data leads tocatastrophic forgetting[51], where the model\nforgets prior knowledge when learning new tasks. To address this, we first incorporateEx-\nemplar Replay(ER) [5], a strategy inspired by 2D incremental methods [1, 43, 54] and\nrecently extended to 3D settings [4], to mitigate forgetting by storing a small set of repre-\nsentative samples from earlier phases. However, ER alone is insufficient to achieve robust\nperformance. To address this, two additional components are introduced: aPseudo-Label\nGenerator(PLG), which leverages a frozen model to generate supervision signals for previ-\nously seen classes, and aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) module that compensates for\nclass imbalance across phases. Each of these components is described in detail below 1. Exemplar Replay (ER).Inspired by Buzzega et al. [5], ER addresses the issue of catas-\ntrophic forgetting by allowing the model to retain a subset of data from earlier phases. During phaset, the model is trained not only on the current task dataD t , but also on a\nset of exemplarsE 1:t−1, collected from previous phases. These exemplars are accumulated\nincrementally:E 1:t−1 =E 1 ∪···∪E t−1 .Here,E t denotes the exemplar subset stored after\nphaset, and|E t |denotes the exemplar replay size. The combined replay dataset is denoted\nas:D t\nER =D t ∪E 1:t−1.Epoch training consists of two stages: first, the model is trained on\nthe current data,D t ; then it is trained using exemplars fromE 1:t−1. While previous CI-3DIS approaches rely on large exemplar sets to mitigate forgetting [4],\nsuch strategies become impractical under memory constraints. Consequently, although ER\naids knowledge retention, it is insufficient on its own for robust performance with a limited\nexemplar budget. Therefore, PLG and CBR are introduced to better preserve past represen-\ntations and enhance generalisation across phases. Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG).In the CI-3DIS setting, during phaset(wheret>1),\nalthough ground-truth labels for previously seen classes are unavailable, the model from the\nprevious phaseΦ t−1 , which preserves knowledge of past tasks, is retained. We use this\nmodel to generate pseudo-labels for previously seen classes, thereby providing approximate\nsupervision during training. This allows the current modelΦt , to retain prior knowledge and\nreduce forgetting, even without access to ground-truth annotations. Given a point cloud and label pair(P,Y t ), fromD t , the previous modelΦ t−1 , generates\npseudo-labels for the previously seen classes as ˆY1:t−1 =Φ t−1 (P), which we denote as ˜Yt\n1For clarity, modifications introduced by each component (ER, PLG, and CBR) are highlighted in green, blue,\nand red, respectively. 6THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D\nfor brevity. However, we observe that utilising all predictions fromΦt−1 introduces noisy or\nincorrect labels, which degrade overall performance. To mitigate this, we select the top-K\nmost confident instance predictions, denoted as ˜Yt\nK, and concatenate them with the ground-\ntruth labels of the current task to obtain the supervision set: ¯Yt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt\nK. Following this,\nthe loss is computed over both the current task’s ground-truth labels and the top-Kconfi-\ndent pseudo-labels from earlier phases, enabling the model to retain prior knowledge while\nadapting to new classes. Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR).While ER and PLG contribute to preserving prior\nknowledge, we observe that the model’s predictions are biased towards frequent classes,\nresulting in the forgetting of rare categories. This issue is further amplified by the top-K\npseudo-labels selected by PLG, which predominantly represent dominant classes in the data. To address this, we propose aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) scheme that compensates\nfor class imbalance using object frequency statistics. At taskt, only the current datasetD t\nand its label distributionp t (c)over classesc∈ Ct are available. Datasets and class distribu-\ntions from earlier tasks{D i,p i(c)}t−1\ni=1 are no longer accessible, which makes it challenging\nto directly account for class imbalance across all previously seen tasks. Therefore, we pro-\npose to leverage the pseudo-label predictions of the frozen modelΦ t−1 as a proxy for the\nclass distribution across previously learned categories. During each training iteration, the previous modelΦ t−1 is applied to the current inputP\nto generate pseudo-labels ˜Yt , from which we accumulate class-wise frequency statistics for\npreviously learned classes. LetC1:t = St\ni=1 Ci represent the union of all classes seen up to task\nt. At the end of each epoch, we compute the overall class frequencyf∈R |C1:t | by combining\nthe pseudo-label distribution ˜pt (c)derived from ˜Yt with the ground-truth label distribution\npt (c)from the current task. The resulting frequency vectorf= [f(c)] c∈C1:t is then used to\ncompute class-wise weightsw= [w(c)] c∈C1:t , which guide balanced pseudo-label selection\nand help the model focus on rare classes. In the next epoch, the modelΦ t−1 produces soft pseudo-label predictions ˜Yt (as de-\nscribed in PLG) , where each component ˜Yt [c]denotes the confidence score for classc∈\nC1:t−1. To promote balanced pseudo-label selection, class-wise re-weighting is applied using\nw(c) = 1\nf(c)+ε , whereεis a small constant for numerical stability. The adjusted predictions\nare computed by applying the class-wise weights as: ˜Yt,w [c] =w(c)· ˜Yt [c],∀c∈ C 1:t−1. Top-Kselection is then applied to both the original and the re-weighted scores, yielding\ntwo pseudo-label sets: ˜Yt\nK and ˜Yt,w\nK , respectively. The final augmented target set, Yt , is\nconstructed by concatenating the ground-truth labelsY t with both sets of pseudo-labels:\nYt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt\nK ∥ ˜Yt,w\nK .(2)\nAlthough the above re-weighting mitigates bias from prior tasks, it does not address class\nimbalance within the current taskt. To resolve this, the class-balanced weightsw c are ex-\ntended to incorporate statistics from both previously seen and current classes, i.e., overC 1:t\nrather than onlyC 1:t−1. The updated weights, denoted asw ′\nc, are used to re-weights both\npseudo-label selection and classification loss, ensuring balanced supervision across all seen\ncategories, including rare ones. This unified strategy reduces bias and enhances performance\nacross phases. The pseudo-code for constructing the supervision set in Eq. (2), which incor-\nporates both PLG and CBR components, is provided in Appendix A.

After every phase, the model must recognise both newly added\nand previously learned classes. For instance, in Task 2, categories such asPillow,Coffee\nTable, andSofa Chairare introduced, while the model is expected to retain recognition\nof earlier classes likeTable,Chair, andCouch. 3D instance segmentation (3DIS) is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves\nidentifying precise object boundaries and class labels in 3D space, with broad applications in\ngraphics, robotics, and augmented reality [4, 39]. Traditional 3DIS methods, including top-\ndown [28, 70, 78], bottom-up [26, 73], and transformer-based approaches [59], perform well\nunder the assumption that all classes are available and balanced during training. However,\nthis assumption does not hold in real-world environments, where new object classes emerge\nover time and exhibit natural imbalance. This gap motivates the need for Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) [17, 54], which sup-\nports learning new categories while retaining knowledge of previous ones [51]. While CIL\nhas seen success in 2D image tasks [1, 43, 54, 60], extensions to 3D point clouds remain\nlimited, often focusing on object-level classification [13, 18, 48]. Recent works on scene-\nlevel class-incremental 3DIS (CI-3DIS) [4] and class-incremental semantic segmentation\n(CI-3DSS) [74] show promise, but depend heavily on large exemplar [56] and overlook class\nimbalance, limiting their practicality. To address this, we proposeCLIMB-3D, a unified framework forCLass-incremental\nIMBalance-aware3DIS that jointly tackles catastrophic forgetting and class imbalance. The\nframework begins with Exemplar Replay (ER), storing a small number of samples from\npast classes for later replay. However, this alone does not yield promising results under the\nstrict memory constraints required in CI-3DIS. To address this, we introduce a Pseudo-Label\nGenerator (PLG), which uses a frozen model from previous task to generate supervision for\nearlier classes. However, we observed that PLG tends to favour frequent classes while ig-\nnoring under-represented ones. To mitigate this, we propose a Class-Balanced Re-weighting\n(CBR), which estimates class frequencies from the pseudo-labels to enhance the learning of\nrare classes without accessing past data. Together, these components form a practical and\neffective solution for real-world 3DIS. To evaluate CLIMB-3D, we designed three benchmark scenarios for CI-3DIS based on\nthe ScanNet200 dataset [57]. These scenarios simulate incremental learning setup under nat-\nural class imbalance, where new classes emerge based on (A) object frequency, (B) semantic\nsimilarity, or (C) random grouping. Additionally, for comparison with existing methods,\nwe evaluate our approach on CI-3DSS using the ScanNetV2 dataset [16]. Experimental re-\nsults show that our method significantly reduces forgetting and improves performance across\nboth frequent and rare categories, outperforming previous methods in both settings. Fig. 1\nillustrates the CI-3DIS setup. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D3\nIn summary, our contributions are: (i) a novel problem setting of imbalanced class-\nincremental 3DIS with an effective method to balance learning and mitigate forgetting; (ii)\nthree benchmarks modelling continual object emergence with natural imbalance; and (iii)\nstrong experimental results, achieving up to 16.76% mAP improvement over baselines. 2 Related Work\n3D Instance Segmentation.Various methods have been proposed for 3DIS. Grouping-\nbased approaches adopt a bottom-up pipeline that learns latent embeddings for point cluster-\ning [9, 21, 22, 29, 37, 44, 70, 78]. In contrast, proposal-based methods follow a top-down\nstrategy by detecting 3D boxes and segmenting objects within them [19, 26, 46, 73, 76]. Recently, transformer-based models [68] have also been applied to 3DIS and 3DSS [59, 64],\ninspired by advances in 2D vision [10, 11]. However, these approaches require full anno-\ntations for all classes and are not designed for progressive learning, where only new class\nannotations are available and previous data is inaccessible. Another line of work aims to re-\nduce annotation costs by proposing weakly supervised 3DIS methods based on sparse cues\n[12, 27, 72]. While effective with limited annotations, these methods assume a fixed set of\nclasses and are susceptible to catastrophic forgetting in incremental settings. Incremental Learning.Continual learning involves training models sequentially to miti-\ngate catastrophic forgetting. One common strategy is model regularisation, which constrains\nparameter updates using techniques such as elastic weight consolidation or knowledge dis-\ntillation [1, 24, 35, 43, 60]. Another approach is exemplar replay, where past data is stored\nor generated to rehearse older tasks while learning new ones [5, 7, 30, 54]. A third direc-\ntion involves dynamically expanding the model architecture or using modular sub-networks\nto accommodate new tasks without interfering with old ones [31, 42, 53, 58, 71, 79]. Re-\ncent efforts in class-incremental 3D segmentation [63, 74] have shown early promise but\noften rely on basic architectures and focus primarily on semantic segmentation. Other works\n[4, 36] explore continual learning in 3D settings, though they often depend on large memory\nbuffers. In contrast, our work introduces a tailored framework for 3D instance segmentation\nthat effectively transfers knowledge across tasks, even under class imbalance. Long-tailed Recognition.Imbalanced class distributions lead to poor recognition of rare\n(long-tail) classes. To address this, re-sampling methods balance the data via input [8, 20, 50,\n52, 61] or feature space [3, 14, 40], avoiding naïve under-/over-sampling. Loss re-weighting\noffers another direction, using class-based [6, 15, 23, 32, 33, 69] or per-example [45, 55, 62]\nadjustments to ensure fair contribution. Parameter regularisation improves generalisation\nthrough weight constraints [2], albeit requiring careful tuning. Other approaches leverage\ntransfer learning [77, 81], self-supervision [41, 75], or contrastive learning [34, 41, 82] to\nimprove rare-class representations. Long-tailed recognition is well-studied in 2D with large-\nscale datasets [15, 49, 67]; in 3D, ScanNet200 [16, 57] enables similar efforts. Prior 3D\nwork focused on re-weighting, re-sampling, and transfer learning [57], while regularisation\nremains underexplored. CeCo [80] balances class centres via auxiliary loss but overlooks\nsampling and augmentation. Lahoud et al. [38] propose adaptive classifier regularisation\nfor 3D segmentation, outperforming prior approaches without threshold tuning. However,\nneither method considers incremental learning. In contrast, we jointly address long-tail and\ncontinual 3D semantic segmentation. 4THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D\nFeature \nBackbone\nTransformer \nDecoder\nFeature \nBackbone\nTransformer \nDecoder\n(𝑷,𝒀𝑡)\nCurrent model (𝛷\n𝑡\n)\nPseudo Label Generator (PLG) \nSelection\n෨𝑌𝐾\n𝑡\nℒCI−3DIS\n෨𝑌𝐾\n𝑡,𝑤\nത𝑌𝐾\n𝑡\n෠𝑌𝑡\n(𝐷𝑡)\nCurrent Dataset \nExemplar \nReplay (ER)\n+\n~\nClass-Balanced  \nRe-weighting \n(CBR)\n1\n𝑓(𝑐)\nFigure 2: Overview ofCLIMB-3Dfor CI-3DIS.

During taskt, point cloudsPand their corresponding labelsY t are\nsampled from a combination of the current training datasetD t and Exemplar Replay (ER),\nwhich maintains a small memory of past examples. These are then passed to the current\nmodelΦ t to produce predicted labelsY t . The Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG) selects the\ntop-Kpredictions from the previous modelΦ t−1 . These pseudo-labels are then weighted\nbased on class frequencyf(c)using Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR), and the top-Kre-\nweighted labels are selected to form the balanced pseudo-label set ¯Yt . This pseudo-label set\nis then concatenated with the ground-truth labels to form a final augmented supervision set\nYt for taskt, which is used to optimise the modelΦ t using Eq. (3). 3 Methodology\n3.1 Problem Formulation\n3DIS.The objective of this task is to detect and segment each object instance within a point\ncloud. Formally, the training dataset is denoted asD={(P i,Yi)}N\ni=1, whereNis the number\nof training samples. Each inputP i ∈R M×6 is a coloured point cloud consisting ofMpoints,\nwhere each point is represented by its 3D coordinates and RGB values. The corresponding\nannotationY i ={(m i,j ,ci,j )}Ji\nj=1 containsJ i object instances, wheremi,j ∈ {0,1}M is a binary\nmask indicating which points belong to thej-th instance, andc i,j ∈ C={1,...,C}is the\nsemantic class label of that instance. GivenP i, the modelΦpredicts instance-level outputs\nˆYi ={(ˆmi,j ,ˆci,j )}\nˆJi\nj=1, where ˆmi,j and ˆci,j denote the predicted mask and category label for\nthej-th instance, respectively. The number of predicted instances ˆJi varies depending on the\nmodel’s inference. The model is optimised using the following objective:\nL3DIS(D;Φ) = 1\n|D| ∑\n(P,Y)∈D\n1\n|Y| ∑\n(mj,cj)∈Y\n(Lmask(mj,ˆmj)+λ·L cls(cj,ˆcj)),(1)\nwhereL cls andL mask are the average classification and mask losses over all instances, andλ\ncontrols their trade-off. CI-3DIS.Unlike conventional 3DIS, CI-3DIS involves sequential learning, where object\ncategories are introduced incrementally overTtraining tasks. Each tasktintroduces a dis-\njoint set of classesC t , withC= ST\nt=1 Ct andC t ∩C t′\n=/ 0 fort̸=t ′. During each taskt, the THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D5\nmodel receives a datasetD t ={(P i,Yt\ni)}N\ni=1, where each coloured point cloudP i ∈R M×6\ncontainsMpoints, and the corresponding annotationY t\ni ={(m t\ni,j ,ct\ni,j )}\nJt\ni\nj=1 includes instance\nmasksm t\ni,j ∈ {0,1}M and semantic class labelsc t\ni,j ∈ Ct . The modelΦ t , initialized from\nΦt−1 , is trained onD t to predict instance-level outputs ˆYt\ni ={(ˆmt\ni,j ,ˆct\ni,j )}\nˆJt\ni\nj=1, where each\npredicted semantic label ˆct\ni,j belongs to the cumulative set of all classes observed so far:St\nk=1 Ck. The key challenge in this setup is to learn new classes without forgetting those\nencountered in previous tasks, despite limited supervision and the absence of past labels. 3.2 Method: CLIMB-3D\nOverview.As shown in Fig. 2 and formulated in Sec. 3.1, the proposed framework for\nCI-3DIS follows aphase-wisetraining strategy. In each phase, the model is exposed to a\ncarefully curated subset of the dataset, simulating real-world scenarios discussed in Sec. 3.3. Training naïvely on such phased data leads tocatastrophic forgetting[51], where the model\nforgets prior knowledge when learning new tasks. To address this, we first incorporateEx-\nemplar Replay(ER) [5], a strategy inspired by 2D incremental methods [1, 43, 54] and\nrecently extended to 3D settings [4], to mitigate forgetting by storing a small set of repre-\nsentative samples from earlier phases. However, ER alone is insufficient to achieve robust\nperformance. To address this, two additional components are introduced: aPseudo-Label\nGenerator(PLG), which leverages a frozen model to generate supervision signals for previ-\nously seen classes, and aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) module that compensates for\nclass imbalance across phases. Each of these components is described in detail below 1. Exemplar Replay (ER).Inspired by Buzzega et al. [5], ER addresses the issue of catas-\ntrophic forgetting by allowing the model to retain a subset of data from earlier phases. During phaset, the model is trained not only on the current task dataD t , but also on a\nset of exemplarsE 1:t−1, collected from previous phases. These exemplars are accumulated\nincrementally:E 1:t−1 =E 1 ∪···∪E t−1 .Here,E t denotes the exemplar subset stored after\nphaset, and|E t |denotes the exemplar replay size. The combined replay dataset is denoted\nas:D t\nER =D t ∪E 1:t−1.Epoch training consists of two stages: first, the model is trained on\nthe current data,D t ; then it is trained using exemplars fromE 1:t−1. While previous CI-3DIS approaches rely on large exemplar sets to mitigate forgetting [4],\nsuch strategies become impractical under memory constraints. Consequently, although ER\naids knowledge retention, it is insufficient on its own for robust performance with a limited\nexemplar budget. Therefore, PLG and CBR are introduced to better preserve past represen-\ntations and enhance generalisation across phases. Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG).In the CI-3DIS setting, during phaset(wheret>1),\nalthough ground-truth labels for previously seen classes are unavailable, the model from the\nprevious phaseΦ t−1 , which preserves knowledge of past tasks, is retained. We use this\nmodel to generate pseudo-labels for previously seen classes, thereby providing approximate\nsupervision during training. This allows the current modelΦt , to retain prior knowledge and\nreduce forgetting, even without access to ground-truth annotations. Given a point cloud and label pair(P,Y t ), fromD t , the previous modelΦ t−1 , generates\npseudo-labels for the previously seen classes as ˆY1:t−1 =Φ t−1 (P), which we denote as ˜Yt\n1For clarity, modifications introduced by each component (ER, PLG, and CBR) are highlighted in green, blue,\nand red, respectively. 6THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D\nfor brevity. However, we observe that utilising all predictions fromΦt−1 introduces noisy or\nincorrect labels, which degrade overall performance. To mitigate this, we select the top-K\nmost confident instance predictions, denoted as ˜Yt\nK, and concatenate them with the ground-\ntruth labels of the current task to obtain the supervision set: ¯Yt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt\nK. Following this,\nthe loss is computed over both the current task’s ground-truth labels and the top-Kconfi-\ndent pseudo-labels from earlier phases, enabling the model to retain prior knowledge while\nadapting to new classes. Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR).While ER and PLG contribute to preserving prior\nknowledge, we observe that the model’s predictions are biased towards frequent classes,\nresulting in the forgetting of rare categories. This issue is further amplified by the top-K\npseudo-labels selected by PLG, which predominantly represent dominant classes in the data. To address this, we propose aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) scheme that compensates\nfor class imbalance using object frequency statistics. At taskt, only the current datasetD t\nand its label distributionp t (c)over classesc∈ Ct are available. Datasets and class distribu-\ntions from earlier tasks{D i,p i(c)}t−1\ni=1 are no longer accessible, which makes it challenging\nto directly account for class imbalance across all previously seen tasks. Therefore, we pro-\npose to leverage the pseudo-label predictions of the frozen modelΦ t−1 as a proxy for the\nclass distribution across previously learned categories. During each training iteration, the previous modelΦ t−1 is applied to the current inputP\nto generate pseudo-labels ˜Yt , from which we accumulate class-wise frequency statistics for\npreviously learned classes. LetC1:t = St\ni=1 Ci represent the union of all classes seen up to task\nt. At the end of each epoch, we compute the overall class frequencyf∈R |C1:t | by combining\nthe pseudo-label distribution ˜pt (c)derived from ˜Yt with the ground-truth label distribution\npt (c)from the current task. The resulting frequency vectorf= [f(c)] c∈C1:t is then used to\ncompute class-wise weightsw= [w(c)] c∈C1:t , which guide balanced pseudo-label selection\nand help the model focus on rare classes. In the next epoch, the modelΦ t−1 produces soft pseudo-label predictions ˜Yt (as de-\nscribed in PLG) , where each component ˜Yt [c]denotes the confidence score for classc∈\nC1:t−1. To promote balanced pseudo-label selection, class-wise re-weighting is applied using\nw(c) = 1\nf(c)+ε , whereεis a small constant for numerical stability. The adjusted predictions\nare computed by applying the class-wise weights as: ˜Yt,w [c] =w(c)· ˜Yt [c],∀c∈ C 1:t−1. Top-Kselection is then applied to both the original and the re-weighted scores, yielding\ntwo pseudo-label sets: ˜Yt\nK and ˜Yt,w\nK , respectively. The final augmented target set, Yt , is\nconstructed by concatenating the ground-truth labelsY t with both sets of pseudo-labels:\nYt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt\nK ∥ ˜Yt,w\nK .(2)\nAlthough the above re-weighting mitigates bias from prior tasks, it does not address class\nimbalance within the current taskt. To resolve this, the class-balanced weightsw c are ex-\ntended to incorporate statistics from both previously seen and current classes, i.e., overC 1:t\nrather than onlyC 1:t−1. The updated weights, denoted asw ′\nc, are used to re-weights both\npseudo-label selection and classification loss, ensuring balanced supervision across all seen\ncategories, including rare ones. This unified strategy reduces bias and enhances performance\nacross phases. The pseudo-code for constructing the supervision set in Eq. (2), which incor-\nporates both PLG and CBR components, is provided in Appendix A.

After every phase, the model must recognise both newly added\nand previously learned classes. For instance, in Task 2, categories such asPillow,Coffee\nTable, andSofa Chairare introduced, while the model is expected to retain recognition\nof earlier classes likeTable,Chair, andCouch. 3D instance segmentation (3DIS) is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves\nidentifying precise object boundaries and class labels in 3D space, with broad applications in\ngraphics, robotics, and augmented reality [4, 39]. Traditional 3DIS methods, including top-\ndown [28, 70, 78], bottom-up [26, 73], and transformer-based approaches [59], perform well\nunder the assumption that all classes are available and balanced during training. However,\nthis assumption does not hold in real-world environments, where new object classes emerge\nover time and exhibit natural imbalance. This gap motivates the need for Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) [17, 54], which sup-\nports learning new categories while retaining knowledge of previous ones [51]. While CIL\nhas seen success in 2D image tasks [1, 43, 54, 60], extensions to 3D point clouds remain\nlimited, often focusing on object-level classification [13, 18, 48]. Recent works on scene-\nlevel class-incremental 3DIS (CI-3DIS) [4] and class-incremental semantic segmentation\n(CI-3DSS) [74] show promise, but depend heavily on large exemplar [56] and overlook class\nimbalance, limiting their practicality. To address this, we proposeCLIMB-3D, a unified framework forCLass-incremental\nIMBalance-aware3DIS that jointly tackles catastrophic forgetting and class imbalance. The\nframework begins with Exemplar Replay (ER), storing a small number of samples from\npast classes for later replay. However, this alone does not yield promising results under the\nstrict memory constraints required in CI-3DIS. To address this, we introduce a Pseudo-Label\nGenerator (PLG), which uses a frozen model from previous task to generate supervision for\nearlier classes. However, we observed that PLG tends to favour frequent classes while ig-\nnoring under-represented ones. To mitigate this, we propose a Class-Balanced Re-weighting\n(CBR), which estimates class frequencies from the pseudo-labels to enhance the learning of\nrare classes without accessing past data. Together, these components form a practical and\neffective solution for real-world 3DIS. To evaluate CLIMB-3D, we designed three benchmark scenarios for CI-3DIS based on\nthe ScanNet200 dataset [57]. These scenarios simulate incremental learning setup under nat-\nural class imbalance, where new classes emerge based on (A) object frequency, (B) semantic\nsimilarity, or (C) random grouping. Additionally, for comparison with existing methods,\nwe evaluate our approach on CI-3DSS using the ScanNetV2 dataset [16]. Experimental re-\nsults show that our method significantly reduces forgetting and improves performance across\nboth frequent and rare categories, outperforming previous methods in both settings. Fig. 1\nillustrates the CI-3DIS setup. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D3\nIn summary, our contributions are: (i) a novel problem setting of imbalanced class-\nincremental 3DIS with an effective method to balance learning and mitigate forgetting; (ii)\nthree benchmarks modelling continual object emergence with natural imbalance; and (iii)\nstrong experimental results, achieving up to 16.76% mAP improvement over baselines. 2 Related Work\n3D Instance Segmentation.Various methods have been proposed for 3DIS. Grouping-\nbased approaches adopt a bottom-up pipeline that learns latent embeddings for point cluster-\ning [9, 21, 22, 29, 37, 44, 70, 78]. In contrast, proposal-based methods follow a top-down\nstrategy by detecting 3D boxes and segmenting objects within them [19, 26, 46, 73, 76]. Recently, transformer-based models [68] have also been applied to 3DIS and 3DSS [59, 64],\ninspired by advances in 2D vision [10, 11]. However, these approaches require full anno-\ntations for all classes and are not designed for progressive learning, where only new class\nannotations are available and previous data is inaccessible. Another line of work aims to re-\nduce annotation costs by proposing weakly supervised 3DIS methods based on sparse cues\n[12, 27, 72]. While effective with limited annotations, these methods assume a fixed set of\nclasses and are susceptible to catastrophic forgetting in incremental settings. Incremental Learning.Continual learning involves training models sequentially to miti-\ngate catastrophic forgetting. One common strategy is model regularisation, which constrains\nparameter updates using techniques such as elastic weight consolidation or knowledge dis-\ntillation [1, 24, 35, 43, 60]. Another approach is exemplar replay, where past data is stored\nor generated to rehearse older tasks while learning new ones [5, 7, 30, 54]. A third direc-\ntion involves dynamically expanding the model architecture or using modular sub-networks\nto accommodate new tasks without interfering with old ones [31, 42, 53, 58, 71, 79]. Re-\ncent efforts in class-incremental 3D segmentation [63, 74] have shown early promise but\noften rely on basic architectures and focus primarily on semantic segmentation. Other works\n[4, 36] explore continual learning in 3D settings, though they often depend on large memory\nbuffers. In contrast, our work introduces a tailored framework for 3D instance segmentation\nthat effectively transfers knowledge across tasks, even under class imbalance. Long-tailed Recognition.Imbalanced class distributions lead to poor recognition of rare\n(long-tail) classes. To address this, re-sampling methods balance the data via input [8, 20, 50,\n52, 61] or feature space [3, 14, 40], avoiding naïve under-/over-sampling. Loss re-weighting\noffers another direction, using class-based [6, 15, 23, 32, 33, 69] or per-example [45, 55, 62]\nadjustments to ensure fair contribution. Parameter regularisation improves generalisation\nthrough weight constraints [2], albeit requiring careful tuning. Other approaches leverage\ntransfer learning [77, 81], self-supervision [41, 75], or contrastive learning [34, 41, 82] to\nimprove rare-class representations. Long-tailed recognition is well-studied in 2D with large-\nscale datasets [15, 49, 67]; in 3D, ScanNet200 [16, 57] enables similar efforts. Prior 3D\nwork focused on re-weighting, re-sampling, and transfer learning [57], while regularisation\nremains underexplored. CeCo [80] balances class centres via auxiliary loss but overlooks\nsampling and augmentation. Lahoud et al. [38] propose adaptive classifier regularisation\nfor 3D segmentation, outperforming prior approaches without threshold tuning. However,\nneither method considers incremental learning. In contrast, we jointly address long-tail and\ncontinual 3D semantic segmentation. 4THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D\nFeature \nBackbone\nTransformer \nDecoder\nFeature \nBackbone\nTransformer \nDecoder\n(𝑷,𝒀𝑡)\nCurrent model (𝛷\n𝑡\n)\nPseudo Label Generator (PLG) \nSelection\n෨𝑌𝐾\n𝑡\nℒCI−3DIS\n෨𝑌𝐾\n𝑡,𝑤\nത𝑌𝐾\n𝑡\n෠𝑌𝑡\n(𝐷𝑡)\nCurrent Dataset \nExemplar \nReplay (ER)\n+\n~\nClass-Balanced  \nRe-weighting \n(CBR)\n1\n𝑓(𝑐)\nFigure 2: Overview ofCLIMB-3Dfor CI-3DIS. The model incrementally learns new classes\nacross sequential phases. During taskt, point cloudsPand their corresponding labelsY t are\nsampled from a combination of the current training datasetD t and Exemplar Replay (ER),\nwhich maintains a small memory of past examples. These are then passed to the current\nmodelΦ t to produce predicted labelsY t . The Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG) selects the\ntop-Kpredictions from the previous modelΦ t−1 . These pseudo-labels are then weighted\nbased on class frequencyf(c)using Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR), and the top-Kre-\nweighted labels are selected to form the balanced pseudo-label set ¯Yt . This pseudo-label set\nis then concatenated with the ground-truth labels to form a final augmented supervision set\nYt for taskt, which is used to optimise the modelΦ t using Eq. (3). 3 Methodology\n3.1 Problem Formulation\n3DIS.The objective of this task is to detect and segment each object instance within a point\ncloud. Formally, the training dataset is denoted asD={(P i,Yi)}N\ni=1, whereNis the number\nof training samples. Each inputP i ∈R M×6 is a coloured point cloud consisting ofMpoints,\nwhere each point is represented by its 3D coordinates and RGB values. The corresponding\nannotationY i ={(m i,j ,ci,j )}Ji\nj=1 containsJ i object instances, wheremi,j ∈ {0,1}M is a binary\nmask indicating which points belong to thej-th instance, andc i,j ∈ C={1,...,C}is the\nsemantic class label of that instance. GivenP i, the modelΦpredicts instance-level outputs\nˆYi ={(ˆmi,j ,ˆci,j )}\nˆJi\nj=1, where ˆmi,j and ˆci,j denote the predicted mask and category label for\nthej-th instance, respectively. The number of predicted instances ˆJi varies depending on the\nmodel’s inference. The model is optimised using the following objective:\nL3DIS(D;Φ) = 1\n|D| ∑\n(P,Y)∈D\n1\n|Y| ∑\n(mj,cj)∈Y\n(Lmask(mj,ˆmj)+λ·L cls(cj,ˆcj)),(1)\nwhereL cls andL mask are the average classification and mask losses over all instances, andλ\ncontrols their trade-off. CI-3DIS.Unlike conventional 3DIS, CI-3DIS involves sequential learning, where object\ncategories are introduced incrementally overTtraining tasks. Each tasktintroduces a dis-\njoint set of classesC t , withC= ST\nt=1 Ct andC t ∩C t′\n=/ 0 fort̸=t ′. During each taskt, the THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D5\nmodel receives a datasetD t ={(P i,Yt\ni)}N\ni=1, where each coloured point cloudP i ∈R M×6\ncontainsMpoints, and the corresponding annotationY t\ni ={(m t\ni,j ,ct\ni,j )}\nJt\ni\nj=1 includes instance\nmasksm t\ni,j ∈ {0,1}M and semantic class labelsc t\ni,j ∈ Ct . The modelΦ t , initialized from\nΦt−1 , is trained onD t to predict instance-level outputs ˆYt\ni ={(ˆmt\ni,j ,ˆct\ni,j )}\nˆJt\ni\nj=1, where each\npredicted semantic label ˆct\ni,j belongs to the cumulative set of all classes observed so far:St\nk=1 Ck. The key challenge in this setup is to learn new classes without forgetting those\nencountered in previous tasks, despite limited supervision and the absence of past labels. 3.2 Method: CLIMB-3D\nOverview.As shown in Fig. 2 and formulated in Sec. 3.1, the proposed framework for\nCI-3DIS follows aphase-wisetraining strategy. In each phase, the model is exposed to a\ncarefully curated subset of the dataset, simulating real-world scenarios discussed in Sec. 3.3. Training naïvely on such phased data leads tocatastrophic forgetting[51], where the model\nforgets prior knowledge when learning new tasks. To address this, we first incorporateEx-\nemplar Replay(ER) [5], a strategy inspired by 2D incremental methods [1, 43, 54] and\nrecently extended to 3D settings [4], to mitigate forgetting by storing a small set of repre-\nsentative samples from earlier phases. However, ER alone is insufficient to achieve robust\nperformance. To address this, two additional components are introduced: aPseudo-Label\nGenerator(PLG), which leverages a frozen model to generate supervision signals for previ-\nously seen classes, and aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) module that compensates for\nclass imbalance across phases. Each of these components is described in detail below 1. Exemplar Replay (ER).Inspired by Buzzega et al. [5], ER addresses the issue of catas-\ntrophic forgetting by allowing the model to retain a subset of data from earlier phases. During phaset, the model is trained not only on the current task dataD t , but also on a\nset of exemplarsE 1:t−1, collected from previous phases. These exemplars are accumulated\nincrementally:E 1:t−1 =E 1 ∪···∪E t−1 .Here,E t denotes the exemplar subset stored after\nphaset, and|E t |denotes the exemplar replay size. The combined replay dataset is denoted\nas:D t\nER =D t ∪E 1:t−1.Epoch training consists of two stages: first, the model is trained on\nthe current data,D t ; then it is trained using exemplars fromE 1:t−1. While previous CI-3DIS approaches rely on large exemplar sets to mitigate forgetting [4],\nsuch strategies become impractical under memory constraints. Consequently, although ER\naids knowledge retention, it is insufficient on its own for robust performance with a limited\nexemplar budget. Therefore, PLG and CBR are introduced to better preserve past represen-\ntations and enhance generalisation across phases. Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG).In the CI-3DIS setting, during phaset(wheret>1),\nalthough ground-truth labels for previously seen classes are unavailable, the model from the\nprevious phaseΦ t−1 , which preserves knowledge of past tasks, is retained. We use this\nmodel to generate pseudo-labels for previously seen classes, thereby providing approximate\nsupervision during training. This allows the current modelΦt , to retain prior knowledge and\nreduce forgetting, even without access to ground-truth annotations. Given a point cloud and label pair(P,Y t ), fromD t , the previous modelΦ t−1 , generates\npseudo-labels for the previously seen classes as ˆY1:t−1 =Φ t−1 (P), which we denote as ˜Yt\n1For clarity, modifications introduced by each component (ER, PLG, and CBR) are highlighted in green, blue,\nand red, respectively. 6THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D\nfor brevity. However, we observe that utilising all predictions fromΦt−1 introduces noisy or\nincorrect labels, which degrade overall performance. To mitigate this, we select the top-K\nmost confident instance predictions, denoted as ˜Yt\nK, and concatenate them with the ground-\ntruth labels of the current task to obtain the supervision set: ¯Yt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt\nK. Following this,\nthe loss is computed over both the current task’s ground-truth labels and the top-Kconfi-\ndent pseudo-labels from earlier phases, enabling the model to retain prior knowledge while\nadapting to new classes. Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR).While ER and PLG contribute to preserving prior\nknowledge, we observe that the model’s predictions are biased towards frequent classes,\nresulting in the forgetting of rare categories. This issue is further amplified by the top-K\npseudo-labels selected by PLG, which predominantly represent dominant classes in the data. To address this, we propose aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) scheme that compensates\nfor class imbalance using object frequency statistics. At taskt, only the current datasetD t\nand its label distributionp t (c)over classesc∈ Ct are available. Datasets and class distribu-\ntions from earlier tasks{D i,p i(c)}t−1\ni=1 are no longer accessible, which makes it challenging\nto directly account for class imbalance across all previously seen tasks. Therefore, we pro-\npose to leverage the pseudo-label predictions of the frozen modelΦ t−1 as a proxy for the\nclass distribution across previously learned categories. During each training iteration, the previous modelΦ t−1 is applied to the current inputP\nto generate pseudo-labels ˜Yt , from which we accumulate class-wise frequency statistics for\npreviously learned classes. LetC1:t = St\ni=1 Ci represent the union of all classes seen up to task\nt. At the end of each epoch, we compute the overall class frequencyf∈R |C1:t | by combining\nthe pseudo-label distribution ˜pt (c)derived from ˜Yt with the ground-truth label distribution\npt (c)from the current task. The resulting frequency vectorf= [f(c)] c∈C1:t is then used to\ncompute class-wise weightsw= [w(c)] c∈C1:t , which guide balanced pseudo-label selection\nand help the model focus on rare classes. In the next epoch, the modelΦ t−1 produces soft pseudo-label predictions ˜Yt (as de-\nscribed in PLG) , where each component ˜Yt [c]denotes the confidence score for classc∈\nC1:t−1. To promote balanced pseudo-label selection, class-wise re-weighting is applied using\nw(c) = 1\nf(c)+ε , whereεis a small constant for numerical stability. The adjusted predictions\nare computed by applying the class-wise weights as: ˜Yt,w [c] =w(c)· ˜Yt [c],∀c∈ C 1:t−1. Top-Kselection is then applied to both the original and the re-weighted scores, yielding\ntwo pseudo-label sets: ˜Yt\nK and ˜Yt,w\nK , respectively. The final augmented target set, Yt , is\nconstructed by concatenating the ground-truth labelsY t with both sets of pseudo-labels:\nYt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt\nK ∥ ˜Yt,w\nK .(2)\nAlthough the above re-weighting mitigates bias from prior tasks, it does not address class\nimbalance within the current taskt. To resolve this, the class-balanced weightsw c are ex-\ntended to incorporate statistics from both previously seen and current classes, i.e., overC 1:t\nrather than onlyC 1:t−1. The updated weights, denoted asw ′\nc, are used to re-weights both\npseudo-label selection and classification loss, ensuring balanced supervision across all seen\ncategories, including rare ones. This unified strategy reduces bias and enhances performance\nacross phases. The pseudo-code for constructing the supervision set in Eq.

However, this assumption is unrealistic in dynamic, real-world environments where new\nclasses emerge gradually and exhibit natural imbalance. Although some approaches ad-\ndress the emergence of new classes, they often overlook class imbalance, which leads\nto suboptimal performance, particularly on rare categories. To tackle this, we propose\nCLIMB-3D, a unified framework forCLass-incrementalImbalance-aware3DIS. Build-\ning upon established exemplar replay (ER) strategies, we show that ER alone is insuf-\nficient to achieve robust performance under memory constraints. To mitigate this, we\nintroduce a novel pseudo-label generator (PLG) that extends supervision to previously\nlearned categories by leveraging predictions from a frozen model trained on prior tasks. Despite its promise, PLG tends to be biased towards frequent classes. Therefore, we\npropose a class-balanced re-weighting (CBR) scheme that estimates object frequencies\nfrom pseudo-labels and dynamically adjusts training bias, without requiring access to\npast data. We design and evaluate three incremental scenarios for 3DIS on the challeng-\ning ScanNet200 dataset and additionally validate our method for semantic segmentation\non ScanNetV2. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing prior work by\nup to 16.76% mAP for instance segmentation and approximately 30% mIoU for semantic\nsegmentation, demonstrating strong generalisation across both frequent and rare classes.

Overall, our proposed\nmethod improves mAP by 5.6%. In this supplementary material, we first demonstrate the performance gains on rare classes\nachieved by incorporating the IC module in Appendix C. Next, we provide detailed split in-\nformation for all scenarios, based on class names, in Appendix D. Finally, we present a qual-\nitative comparison between the baseline method and our proposed approach in Appendix\nE. Appendix C Evaluation on Rare Categories\nThe proposed imbalance correction (IC) module, as detailed in Section 4.2, is designed to\naddress the performance gap for rare classes. To assess its impact, we compare its perfor-\nmance with the framework which has exemplar replay (ER) and knowledge distillation (KD). Specifically, we focus on its ability to improve performance for rare classes, which the model\nencounters infrequently compared to more common classes. The results, shown in Tab.\n\nhighlighting instances where the baseline method underperforms, marked with red circles.\n\n5 and Tab. 6, correspond to evaluations onSplit-AforPhase\n2andPhase 3, respectively. InPhase 2, we evaluate classes seen 1–20 times per epoch,\nwhilePhase 3targets even less frequent classes, with observations limited to 1–10 times per\nepoch. As illustrated in Tab. 5, the IC module substantially improves performance on rare\nclasses in terms of mAP 50 in Phase 2 ofSplit-A. For instance, classes likerecycling\nbinandtrash bin, seen only 3 and 7 times, respectively, shows significant improvement\nwhen the IC module is applied. Overall, the IC module provides an average boost of 8.32%,\nhighlighting its effectiveness in mitigating class imbalance. Similarly, Tab. 6 presents results forPhase 3, demonstrating significant gains for infre-\nquent classes. For example, even though the classes such aspiano,bucket, andlaundry\nbasketare observed only once, IC module improves the performance by 52.30%, 10.40%,\nand 13.60%, respectively. The ER+KD module does not focus on rare classes likeshower\nandtoasterwhich results in low performance, but the IC module compensates for this imbal-\nance by focusing on underrepresented categories.

However, this assumption is unrealistic in dynamic, real-world environments where new\nclasses emerge gradually and exhibit natural imbalance. Although some approaches ad-\ndress the emergence of new classes, they often overlook class imbalance, which leads\nto suboptimal performance, particularly on rare categories. To tackle this, we propose\nCLIMB-3D, a unified framework forCLass-incrementalImbalance-aware3DIS. Build-\ning upon established exemplar replay (ER) strategies, we show that ER alone is insuf-\nficient to achieve robust performance under memory constraints. To mitigate this, we\nintroduce a novel pseudo-label generator (PLG) that extends supervision to previously\nlearned categories by leveraging predictions from a frozen model trained on prior tasks. Despite its promise, PLG tends to be biased towards frequent classes. Therefore, we\npropose a class-balanced re-weighting (CBR) scheme that estimates object frequencies\nfrom pseudo-labels and dynamically adjusts training bias, without requiring access to\npast data. We design and evaluate three incremental scenarios for 3DIS on the challeng-\ning ScanNet200 dataset and additionally validate our method for semantic segmentation\non ScanNetV2. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing prior work by\nup to 16.76% mAP for instance segmentation and approximately 30% mIoU for semantic\nsegmentation, demonstrating strong generalisation across both frequent and rare classes.

After every phase, the model must recognise both newly added\nand previously learned classes. For instance, in Task 2, categories such asPillow,Coffee\nTable, andSofa Chairare introduced, while the model is expected to retain recognition\nof earlier classes likeTable,Chair, andCouch. 3D instance segmentation (3DIS) is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves\nidentifying precise object boundaries and class labels in 3D space, with broad applications in\ngraphics, robotics, and augmented reality [4, 39]. Traditional 3DIS methods, including top-\ndown [28, 70, 78], bottom-up [26, 73], and transformer-based approaches [59], perform well\nunder the assumption that all classes are available and balanced during training. However,\nthis assumption does not hold in real-world environments, where new object classes emerge\nover time and exhibit natural imbalance. This gap motivates the need for Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) [17, 54], which sup-\nports learning new categories while retaining knowledge of previous ones [51]. While CIL\nhas seen success in 2D image tasks [1, 43, 54, 60], extensions to 3D point clouds remain\nlimited, often focusing on object-level classification [13, 18, 48]. Recent works on scene-\nlevel class-incremental 3DIS (CI-3DIS) [4] and class-incremental semantic segmentation\n(CI-3DSS) [74] show promise, but depend heavily on large exemplar [56] and overlook class\nimbalance, limiting their practicality. To address this, we proposeCLIMB-3D, a unified framework forCLass-incremental\nIMBalance-aware3DIS that jointly tackles catastrophic forgetting and class imbalance. The\nframework begins with Exemplar Replay (ER), storing a small number of samples from\npast classes for later replay. However, this alone does not yield promising results under the\nstrict memory constraints required in CI-3DIS. To address this, we introduce a Pseudo-Label\nGenerator (PLG), which uses a frozen model from previous task to generate supervision for\nearlier classes. However, we observed that PLG tends to favour frequent classes while ig-\nnoring under-represented ones. To mitigate this, we propose a Class-Balanced Re-weighting\n(CBR), which estimates class frequencies from the pseudo-labels to enhance the learning of\nrare classes without accessing past data. Together, these components form a practical and\neffective solution for real-world 3DIS. To evaluate CLIMB-3D, we designed three benchmark scenarios for CI-3DIS based on\nthe ScanNet200 dataset [57]. These scenarios simulate incremental learning setup under nat-\nural class imbalance, where new classes emerge based on (A) object frequency, (B) semantic\nsimilarity, or (C) random grouping. Additionally, for comparison with existing methods,\nwe evaluate our approach on CI-3DSS using the ScanNetV2 dataset [16]. Experimental re-\nsults show that our method significantly reduces forgetting and improves performance across\nboth frequent and rare categories, outperforming previous methods in both settings. Fig. 1\nillustrates the CI-3DIS setup. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D3\nIn summary, our contributions are: (i) a novel problem setting of imbalanced class-\nincremental 3DIS with an effective method to balance learning and mitigate forgetting; (ii)\nthree benchmarks modelling continual object emergence with natural imbalance; and (iii)\nstrong experimental results, achieving up to 16.76% mAP improvement over baselines. 2 Related Work\n3D Instance Segmentation.Various methods have been proposed for 3DIS. Grouping-\nbased approaches adopt a bottom-up pipeline that learns latent embeddings for point cluster-\ning [9, 21, 22, 29, 37, 44, 70, 78]. In contrast, proposal-based methods follow a top-down\nstrategy by detecting 3D boxes and segmenting objects within them [19, 26, 46, 73, 76]. Recently, transformer-based models [68] have also been applied to 3DIS and 3DSS [59, 64],\ninspired by advances in 2D vision [10, 11]. However, these approaches require full anno-\ntations for all classes and are not designed for progressive learning, where only new class\nannotations are available and previous data is inaccessible. Another line of work aims to re-\nduce annotation costs by proposing weakly supervised 3DIS methods based on sparse cues\n[12, 27, 72]. While effective with limited annotations, these methods assume a fixed set of\nclasses and are susceptible to catastrophic forgetting in incremental settings. Incremental Learning.Continual learning involves training models sequentially to miti-\ngate catastrophic forgetting. One common strategy is model regularisation, which constrains\nparameter updates using techniques such as elastic weight consolidation or knowledge dis-\ntillation [1, 24, 35, 43, 60]. Another approach is exemplar replay, where past data is stored\nor generated to rehearse older tasks while learning new ones [5, 7, 30, 54]. A third direc-\ntion involves dynamically expanding the model architecture or using modular sub-networks\nto accommodate new tasks without interfering with old ones [31, 42, 53, 58, 71, 79]. Re-\ncent efforts in class-incremental 3D segmentation [63, 74] have shown early promise but\noften rely on basic architectures and focus primarily on semantic segmentation. Other works\n[4, 36] explore continual learning in 3D settings, though they often depend on large memory\nbuffers. In contrast, our work introduces a tailored framework for 3D instance segmentation\nthat effectively transfers knowledge across tasks, even under class imbalance. Long-tailed Recognition.Imbalanced class distributions lead to poor recognition of rare\n(long-tail) classes. To address this, re-sampling methods balance the data via input [8, 20, 50,\n52, 61] or feature space [3, 14, 40], avoiding naïve under-/over-sampling. Loss re-weighting\noffers another direction, using class-based [6, 15, 23, 32, 33, 69] or per-example [45, 55, 62]\nadjustments to ensure fair contribution. Parameter regularisation improves generalisation\nthrough weight constraints [2], albeit requiring careful tuning. Other approaches leverage\ntransfer learning [77, 81], self-supervision [41, 75], or contrastive learning [34, 41, 82] to\nimprove rare-class representations. Long-tailed recognition is well-studied in 2D with large-\nscale datasets [15, 49, 67]; in 3D, ScanNet200 [16, 57] enables similar efforts. Prior 3D\nwork focused on re-weighting, re-sampling, and transfer learning [57], while regularisation\nremains underexplored. CeCo [80] balances class centres via auxiliary loss but overlooks\nsampling and augmentation. Lahoud et al. [38] propose adaptive classifier regularisation\nfor 3D segmentation, outperforming prior approaches without threshold tuning. However,\nneither method considers incremental learning. In contrast, we jointly address long-tail and\ncontinual 3D semantic segmentation. 4THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D\nFeature \nBackbone\nTransformer \nDecoder\nFeature \nBackbone\nTransformer \nDecoder\n(𝑷,𝒀𝑡)\nCurrent model (𝛷\n𝑡\n)\nPseudo Label Generator (PLG) \nSelection\n෨𝑌𝐾\n𝑡\nℒCI−3DIS\n෨𝑌𝐾\n𝑡,𝑤\nത𝑌𝐾\n𝑡\n෠𝑌𝑡\n(𝐷𝑡)\nCurrent Dataset \nExemplar \nReplay (ER)\n+\n~\nClass-Balanced  \nRe-weighting \n(CBR)\n1\n𝑓(𝑐)\nFigure 2: Overview ofCLIMB-3Dfor CI-3DIS. The model incrementally learns new classes\nacross sequential phases. During taskt, point cloudsPand their corresponding labelsY t are\nsampled from a combination of the current training datasetD t and Exemplar Replay (ER),\nwhich maintains a small memory of past examples. These are then passed to the current\nmodelΦ t to produce predicted labelsY t . The Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG) selects the\ntop-Kpredictions from the previous modelΦ t−1 . These pseudo-labels are then weighted\nbased on class frequencyf(c)using Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR), and the top-Kre-\nweighted labels are selected to form the balanced pseudo-label set ¯Yt . This pseudo-label set\nis then concatenated with the ground-truth labels to form a final augmented supervision set\nYt for taskt, which is used to optimise the modelΦ t using Eq. (3). 3 Methodology\n3.1 Problem Formulation\n3DIS.The objective of this task is to detect and segment each object instance within a point\ncloud. Formally, the training dataset is denoted asD={(P i,Yi)}N\ni=1, whereNis the number\nof training samples. Each inputP i ∈R M×6 is a coloured point cloud consisting ofMpoints,\nwhere each point is represented by its 3D coordinates and RGB values. The corresponding\nannotationY i ={(m i,j ,ci,j )}Ji\nj=1 containsJ i object instances, wheremi,j ∈ {0,1}M is a binary\nmask indicating which points belong to thej-th instance, andc i,j ∈ C={1,...,C}is the\nsemantic class label of that instance. GivenP i, the modelΦpredicts instance-level outputs\nˆYi ={(ˆmi,j ,ˆci,j )}\nˆJi\nj=1, where ˆmi,j and ˆci,j denote the predicted mask and category label for\nthej-th instance, respectively. The number of predicted instances ˆJi varies depending on the\nmodel’s inference. The model is optimised using the following objective:\nL3DIS(D;Φ) = 1\n|D| ∑\n(P,Y)∈D\n1\n|Y| ∑\n(mj,cj)∈Y\n(Lmask(mj,ˆmj)+λ·L cls(cj,ˆcj)),(1)\nwhereL cls andL mask are the average classification and mask losses over all instances, andλ\ncontrols their trade-off. CI-3DIS.Unlike conventional 3DIS, CI-3DIS involves sequential learning, where object\ncategories are introduced incrementally overTtraining tasks. Each tasktintroduces a dis-\njoint set of classesC t , withC= ST\nt=1 Ct andC t ∩C t′\n=/ 0 fort̸=t ′. During each taskt, the THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D5\nmodel receives a datasetD t ={(P i,Yt\ni)}N\ni=1, where each coloured point cloudP i ∈R M×6\ncontainsMpoints, and the corresponding annotationY t\ni ={(m t\ni,j ,ct\ni,j )}\nJt\ni\nj=1 includes instance\nmasksm t\ni,j ∈ {0,1}M and semantic class labelsc t\ni,j ∈ Ct . The modelΦ t , initialized from\nΦt−1 , is trained onD t to predict instance-level outputs ˆYt\ni ={(ˆmt\ni,j ,ˆct\ni,j )}\nˆJt\ni\nj=1, where each\npredicted semantic label ˆct\ni,j belongs to the cumulative set of all classes observed so far:St\nk=1 Ck. The key challenge in this setup is to learn new classes without forgetting those\nencountered in previous tasks, despite limited supervision and the absence of past labels. 3.2 Method: CLIMB-3D\nOverview.As shown in Fig. 2 and formulated in Sec. 3.1, the proposed framework for\nCI-3DIS follows aphase-wisetraining strategy. In each phase, the model is exposed to a\ncarefully curated subset of the dataset, simulating real-world scenarios discussed in Sec. 3.3. Training naïvely on such phased data leads tocatastrophic forgetting[51], where the model\nforgets prior knowledge when learning new tasks. To address this, we first incorporateEx-\nemplar Replay(ER) [5], a strategy inspired by 2D incremental methods [1, 43, 54] and\nrecently extended to 3D settings [4], to mitigate forgetting by storing a small set of repre-\nsentative samples from earlier phases. However, ER alone is insufficient to achieve robust\nperformance. To address this, two additional components are introduced: aPseudo-Label\nGenerator(PLG), which leverages a frozen model to generate supervision signals for previ-\nously seen classes, and aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) module that compensates for\nclass imbalance across phases. Each of these components is described in detail below 1. Exemplar Replay (ER).Inspired by Buzzega et al. [5], ER addresses the issue of catas-\ntrophic forgetting by allowing the model to retain a subset of data from earlier phases. During phaset, the model is trained not only on the current task dataD t , but also on a\nset of exemplarsE 1:t−1, collected from previous phases. These exemplars are accumulated\nincrementally:E 1:t−1 =E 1 ∪···∪E t−1 .Here,E t denotes the exemplar subset stored after\nphaset, and|E t |denotes the exemplar replay size. The combined replay dataset is denoted\nas:D t\nER =D t ∪E 1:t−1.Epoch training consists of two stages: first, the model is trained on\nthe current data,D t ; then it is trained using exemplars fromE 1:t−1. While previous CI-3DIS approaches rely on large exemplar sets to mitigate forgetting [4],\nsuch strategies become impractical under memory constraints. Consequently, although ER\naids knowledge retention, it is insufficient on its own for robust performance with a limited\nexemplar budget. Therefore, PLG and CBR are introduced to better preserve past represen-\ntations and enhance generalisation across phases. Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG).In the CI-3DIS setting, during phaset(wheret>1),\nalthough ground-truth labels for previously seen classes are unavailable, the model from the\nprevious phaseΦ t−1 , which preserves knowledge of past tasks, is retained. We use this\nmodel to generate pseudo-labels for previously seen classes, thereby providing approximate\nsupervision during training. This allows the current modelΦt , to retain prior knowledge and\nreduce forgetting, even without access to ground-truth annotations. Given a point cloud and label pair(P,Y t ), fromD t , the previous modelΦ t−1 , generates\npseudo-labels for the previously seen classes as ˆY1:t−1 =Φ t−1 (P), which we denote as ˜Yt\n1For clarity, modifications introduced by each component (ER, PLG, and CBR) are highlighted in green, blue,\nand red, respectively. 6THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D\nfor brevity. However, we observe that utilising all predictions fromΦt−1 introduces noisy or\nincorrect labels, which degrade overall performance. To mitigate this, we select the top-K\nmost confident instance predictions, denoted as ˜Yt\nK, and concatenate them with the ground-\ntruth labels of the current task to obtain the supervision set: ¯Yt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt\nK. Following this,\nthe loss is computed over both the current task’s ground-truth labels and the top-Kconfi-\ndent pseudo-labels from earlier phases, enabling the model to retain prior knowledge while\nadapting to new classes. Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR).While ER and PLG contribute to preserving prior\nknowledge, we observe that the model’s predictions are biased towards frequent classes,\nresulting in the forgetting of rare categories. This issue is further amplified by the top-K\npseudo-labels selected by PLG, which predominantly represent dominant classes in the data. To address this, we propose aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) scheme that compensates\nfor class imbalance using object frequency statistics. At taskt, only the current datasetD t\nand its label distributionp t (c)over classesc∈ Ct are available. Datasets and class distribu-\ntions from earlier tasks{D i,p i(c)}t−1\ni=1 are no longer accessible, which makes it challenging\nto directly account for class imbalance across all previously seen tasks. Therefore, we pro-\npose to leverage the pseudo-label predictions of the frozen modelΦ t−1 as a proxy for the\nclass distribution across previously learned categories. During each training iteration, the previous modelΦ t−1 is applied to the current inputP\nto generate pseudo-labels ˜Yt , from which we accumulate class-wise frequency statistics for\npreviously learned classes. LetC1:t = St\ni=1 Ci represent the union of all classes seen up to task\nt. At the end of each epoch, we compute the overall class frequencyf∈R |C1:t | by combining\nthe pseudo-label distribution ˜pt (c)derived from ˜Yt with the ground-truth label distribution\npt (c)from the current task. The resulting frequency vectorf= [f(c)] c∈C1:t is then used to\ncompute class-wise weightsw= [w(c)] c∈C1:t , which guide balanced pseudo-label selection\nand help the model focus on rare classes. In the next epoch, the modelΦ t−1 produces soft pseudo-label predictions ˜Yt (as de-\nscribed in PLG) , where each component ˜Yt [c]denotes the confidence score for classc∈\nC1:t−1. To promote balanced pseudo-label selection, class-wise re-weighting is applied using\nw(c) = 1\nf(c)+ε , whereεis a small constant for numerical stability. The adjusted predictions\nare computed by applying the class-wise weights as: ˜Yt,w [c] =w(c)· ˜Yt [c],∀c∈ C 1:t−1. Top-Kselection is then applied to both the original and the re-weighted scores, yielding\ntwo pseudo-label sets: ˜Yt\nK and ˜Yt,w\nK , respectively. The final augmented target set, Yt , is\nconstructed by concatenating the ground-truth labelsY t with both sets of pseudo-labels:\nYt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt\nK ∥ ˜Yt,w\nK .(2)\nAlthough the above re-weighting mitigates bias from prior tasks, it does not address class\nimbalance within the current taskt. To resolve this, the class-balanced weightsw c are ex-\ntended to incorporate statistics from both previously seen and current classes, i.e., overC 1:t\nrather than onlyC 1:t−1. The updated weights, denoted asw ′\nc, are used to re-weights both\npseudo-label selection and classification loss, ensuring balanced supervision across all seen\ncategories, including rare ones. This unified strategy reduces bias and enhances performance\nacross phases. The pseudo-code for constructing the supervision set in Eq. (2), which incor-\nporates both PLG and CBR components, is provided in Appendix A.

However, this assumption is unrealistic in dynamic, real-world environments where new\nclasses emerge gradually and exhibit natural imbalance. Although some approaches ad-\ndress the emergence of new classes, they often overlook class imbalance, which leads\nto suboptimal performance, particularly on rare categories. To tackle this, we propose\nCLIMB-3D, a unified framework forCLass-incrementalImbalance-aware3DIS. Build-\ning upon established exemplar replay (ER) strategies, we show that ER alone is insuf-\nficient to achieve robust performance under memory constraints. To mitigate this, we\nintroduce a novel pseudo-label generator (PLG) that extends supervision to previously\nlearned categories by leveraging predictions from a frozen model trained on prior tasks. Despite its promise, PLG tends to be biased towards frequent classes. Therefore, we\npropose a class-balanced re-weighting (CBR) scheme that estimates object frequencies\nfrom pseudo-labels and dynamically adjusts training bias, without requiring access to\npast data. We design and evaluate three incremental scenarios for 3DIS on the challeng-\ning ScanNet200 dataset and additionally validate our method for semantic segmentation\non ScanNetV2. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing prior work by\nup to 16.76% mAP for instance segmentation and approximately 30% mIoU for semantic\nsegmentation, demonstrating strong generalisation across both frequent and rare classes.

After every phase, the model must recognise both newly added\nand previously learned classes. For instance, in Task 2, categories such asPillow,Coffee\nTable, andSofa Chairare introduced, while the model is expected to retain recognition\nof earlier classes likeTable,Chair, andCouch. 3D instance segmentation (3DIS) is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves\nidentifying precise object boundaries and class labels in 3D space, with broad applications in\ngraphics, robotics, and augmented reality [4, 39]. Traditional 3DIS methods, including top-\ndown [28, 70, 78], bottom-up [26, 73], and transformer-based approaches [59], perform well\nunder the assumption that all classes are available and balanced during training. However,\nthis assumption does not hold in real-world environments, where new object classes emerge\nover time and exhibit natural imbalance. This gap motivates the need for Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) [17, 54], which sup-\nports learning new categories while retaining knowledge of previous ones [51]. While CIL\nhas seen success in 2D image tasks [1, 43, 54, 60], extensions to 3D point clouds remain\nlimited, often focusing on object-level classification [13, 18, 48]. Recent works on scene-\nlevel class-incremental 3DIS (CI-3DIS) [4] and class-incremental semantic segmentation\n(CI-3DSS) [74] show promise, but depend heavily on large exemplar [56] and overlook class\nimbalance, limiting their practicality. To address this, we proposeCLIMB-3D, a unified framework forCLass-incremental\nIMBalance-aware3DIS that jointly tackles catastrophic forgetting and class imbalance. The\nframework begins with Exemplar Replay (ER), storing a small number of samples from\npast classes for later replay. However, this alone does not yield promising results under the\nstrict memory constraints required in CI-3DIS. To address this, we introduce a Pseudo-Label\nGenerator (PLG), which uses a frozen model from previous task to generate supervision for\nearlier classes. However, we observed that PLG tends to favour frequent classes while ig-\nnoring under-represented ones. To mitigate this, we propose a Class-Balanced Re-weighting\n(CBR), which estimates class frequencies from the pseudo-labels to enhance the learning of\nrare classes without accessing past data. Together, these components form a practical and\neffective solution for real-world 3DIS. To evaluate CLIMB-3D, we designed three benchmark scenarios for CI-3DIS based on\nthe ScanNet200 dataset [57]. These scenarios simulate incremental learning setup under nat-\nural class imbalance, where new classes emerge based on (A) object frequency, (B) semantic\nsimilarity, or (C) random grouping. Additionally, for comparison with existing methods,\nwe evaluate our approach on CI-3DSS using the ScanNetV2 dataset [16]. Experimental re-\nsults show that our method significantly reduces forgetting and improves performance across\nboth frequent and rare categories, outperforming previous methods in both settings. Fig. 1\nillustrates the CI-3DIS setup. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D3\nIn summary, our contributions are: (i) a novel problem setting of imbalanced class-\nincremental 3DIS with an effective method to balance learning and mitigate forgetting; (ii)\nthree benchmarks modelling continual object emergence with natural imbalance; and (iii)\nstrong experimental results, achieving up to 16.76% mAP improvement over baselines. 2 Related Work\n3D Instance Segmentation.Various methods have been proposed for 3DIS. Grouping-\nbased approaches adopt a bottom-up pipeline that learns latent embeddings for point cluster-\ning [9, 21, 22, 29, 37, 44, 70, 78]. In contrast, proposal-based methods follow a top-down\nstrategy by detecting 3D boxes and segmenting objects within them [19, 26, 46, 73, 76]. Recently, transformer-based models [68] have also been applied to 3DIS and 3DSS [59, 64],\ninspired by advances in 2D vision [10, 11]. However, these approaches require full anno-\ntations for all classes and are not designed for progressive learning, where only new class\nannotations are available and previous data is inaccessible. Another line of work aims to re-\nduce annotation costs by proposing weakly supervised 3DIS methods based on sparse cues\n[12, 27, 72]. While effective with limited annotations, these methods assume a fixed set of\nclasses and are susceptible to catastrophic forgetting in incremental settings. Incremental Learning.Continual learning involves training models sequentially to miti-\ngate catastrophic forgetting. One common strategy is model regularisation, which constrains\nparameter updates using techniques such as elastic weight consolidation or knowledge dis-\ntillation [1, 24, 35, 43, 60]. Another approach is exemplar replay, where past data is stored\nor generated to rehearse older tasks while learning new ones [5, 7, 30, 54]. A third direc-\ntion involves dynamically expanding the model architecture or using modular sub-networks\nto accommodate new tasks without interfering with old ones [31, 42, 53, 58, 71, 79]. Re-\ncent efforts in class-incremental 3D segmentation [63, 74] have shown early promise but\noften rely on basic architectures and focus primarily on semantic segmentation. Other works\n[4, 36] explore continual learning in 3D settings, though they often depend on large memory\nbuffers. In contrast, our work introduces a tailored framework for 3D instance segmentation\nthat effectively transfers knowledge across tasks, even under class imbalance. Long-tailed Recognition.Imbalanced class distributions lead to poor recognition of rare\n(long-tail) classes. To address this, re-sampling methods balance the data via input [8, 20, 50,\n52, 61] or feature space [3, 14, 40], avoiding naïve under-/over-sampling. Loss re-weighting\noffers another direction, using class-based [6, 15, 23, 32, 33, 69] or per-example [45, 55, 62]\nadjustments to ensure fair contribution. Parameter regularisation improves generalisation\nthrough weight constraints [2], albeit requiring careful tuning. Other approaches leverage\ntransfer learning [77, 81], self-supervision [41, 75], or contrastive learning [34, 41, 82] to\nimprove rare-class representations. Long-tailed recognition is well-studied in 2D with large-\nscale datasets [15, 49, 67]; in 3D, ScanNet200 [16, 57] enables similar efforts. Prior 3D\nwork focused on re-weighting, re-sampling, and transfer learning [57], while regularisation\nremains underexplored. CeCo [80] balances class centres via auxiliary loss but overlooks\nsampling and augmentation. Lahoud et al. [38] propose adaptive classifier regularisation\nfor 3D segmentation, outperforming prior approaches without threshold tuning. However,\nneither method considers incremental learning. In contrast, we jointly address long-tail and\ncontinual 3D semantic segmentation. 4THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D\nFeature \nBackbone\nTransformer \nDecoder\nFeature \nBackbone\nTransformer \nDecoder\n(𝑷,𝒀𝑡)\nCurrent model (𝛷\n𝑡\n)\nPseudo Label Generator (PLG) \nSelection\n෨𝑌𝐾\n𝑡\nℒCI−3DIS\n෨𝑌𝐾\n𝑡,𝑤\nത𝑌𝐾\n𝑡\n෠𝑌𝑡\n(𝐷𝑡)\nCurrent Dataset \nExemplar \nReplay (ER)\n+\n~\nClass-Balanced  \nRe-weighting \n(CBR)\n1\n𝑓(𝑐)\nFigure 2: Overview ofCLIMB-3Dfor CI-3DIS. The model incrementally learns new classes\nacross sequential phases. During taskt, point cloudsPand their corresponding labelsY t are\nsampled from a combination of the current training datasetD t and Exemplar Replay (ER),\nwhich maintains a small memory of past examples. These are then passed to the current\nmodelΦ t to produce predicted labelsY t . The Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG) selects the\ntop-Kpredictions from the previous modelΦ t−1 . These pseudo-labels are then weighted\nbased on class frequencyf(c)using Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR), and the top-Kre-\nweighted labels are selected to form the balanced pseudo-label set ¯Yt . This pseudo-label set\nis then concatenated with the ground-truth labels to form a final augmented supervision set\nYt for taskt, which is used to optimise the modelΦ t using Eq. (3). 3 Methodology\n3.1 Problem Formulation\n3DIS.The objective of this task is to detect and segment each object instance within a point\ncloud. Formally, the training dataset is denoted asD={(P i,Yi)}N\ni=1, whereNis the number\nof training samples. Each inputP i ∈R M×6 is a coloured point cloud consisting ofMpoints,\nwhere each point is represented by its 3D coordinates and RGB values. The corresponding\nannotationY i ={(m i,j ,ci,j )}Ji\nj=1 containsJ i object instances, wheremi,j ∈ {0,1}M is a binary\nmask indicating which points belong to thej-th instance, andc i,j ∈ C={1,...,C}is the\nsemantic class label of that instance. GivenP i, the modelΦpredicts instance-level outputs\nˆYi ={(ˆmi,j ,ˆci,j )}\nˆJi\nj=1, where ˆmi,j and ˆci,j denote the predicted mask and category label for\nthej-th instance, respectively. The number of predicted instances ˆJi varies depending on the\nmodel’s inference. The model is optimised using the following objective:\nL3DIS(D;Φ) = 1\n|D| ∑\n(P,Y)∈D\n1\n|Y| ∑\n(mj,cj)∈Y\n(Lmask(mj,ˆmj)+λ·L cls(cj,ˆcj)),(1)\nwhereL cls andL mask are the average classification and mask losses over all instances, andλ\ncontrols their trade-off. CI-3DIS.Unlike conventional 3DIS, CI-3DIS involves sequential learning, where object\ncategories are introduced incrementally overTtraining tasks. Each tasktintroduces a dis-\njoint set of classesC t , withC= ST\nt=1 Ct andC t ∩C t′\n=/ 0 fort̸=t ′. During each taskt, the THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D5\nmodel receives a datasetD t ={(P i,Yt\ni)}N\ni=1, where each coloured point cloudP i ∈R M×6\ncontainsMpoints, and the corresponding annotationY t\ni ={(m t\ni,j ,ct\ni,j )}\nJt\ni\nj=1 includes instance\nmasksm t\ni,j ∈ {0,1}M and semantic class labelsc t\ni,j ∈ Ct . The modelΦ t , initialized from\nΦt−1 , is trained onD t to predict instance-level outputs ˆYt\ni ={(ˆmt\ni,j ,ˆct\ni,j )}\nˆJt\ni\nj=1, where each\npredicted semantic label ˆct\ni,j belongs to the cumulative set of all classes observed so far:St\nk=1 Ck. The key challenge in this setup is to learn new classes without forgetting those\nencountered in previous tasks, despite limited supervision and the absence of past labels. 3.2 Method: CLIMB-3D\nOverview.As shown in Fig. 2 and formulated in Sec. 3.1, the proposed framework for\nCI-3DIS follows aphase-wisetraining strategy. In each phase, the model is exposed to a\ncarefully curated subset of the dataset, simulating real-world scenarios discussed in Sec. 3.3. Training naïvely on such phased data leads tocatastrophic forgetting[51], where the model\nforgets prior knowledge when learning new tasks. To address this, we first incorporateEx-\nemplar Replay(ER) [5], a strategy inspired by 2D incremental methods [1, 43, 54] and\nrecently extended to 3D settings [4], to mitigate forgetting by storing a small set of repre-\nsentative samples from earlier phases. However, ER alone is insufficient to achieve robust\nperformance. To address this, two additional components are introduced: aPseudo-Label\nGenerator(PLG), which leverages a frozen model to generate supervision signals for previ-\nously seen classes, and aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) module that compensates for\nclass imbalance across phases. Each of these components is described in detail below 1. Exemplar Replay (ER).Inspired by Buzzega et al. [5], ER addresses the issue of catas-\ntrophic forgetting by allowing the model to retain a subset of data from earlier phases. During phaset, the model is trained not only on the current task dataD t , but also on a\nset of exemplarsE 1:t−1, collected from previous phases. These exemplars are accumulated\nincrementally:E 1:t−1 =E 1 ∪···∪E t−1 .Here,E t denotes the exemplar subset stored after\nphaset, and|E t |denotes the exemplar replay size. The combined replay dataset is denoted\nas:D t\nER =D t ∪E 1:t−1.Epoch training consists of two stages: first, the model is trained on\nthe current data,D t ; then it is trained using exemplars fromE 1:t−1. While previous CI-3DIS approaches rely on large exemplar sets to mitigate forgetting [4],\nsuch strategies become impractical under memory constraints. Consequently, although ER\naids knowledge retention, it is insufficient on its own for robust performance with a limited\nexemplar budget. Therefore, PLG and CBR are introduced to better preserve past represen-\ntations and enhance generalisation across phases. Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG).In the CI-3DIS setting, during phaset(wheret>1),\nalthough ground-truth labels for previously seen classes are unavailable, the model from the\nprevious phaseΦ t−1 , which preserves knowledge of past tasks, is retained. We use this\nmodel to generate pseudo-labels for previously seen classes, thereby providing approximate\nsupervision during training. This allows the current modelΦt , to retain prior knowledge and\nreduce forgetting, even without access to ground-truth annotations. Given a point cloud and label pair(P,Y t ), fromD t , the previous modelΦ t−1 , generates\npseudo-labels for the previously seen classes as ˆY1:t−1 =Φ t−1 (P), which we denote as ˜Yt\n1For clarity, modifications introduced by each component (ER, PLG, and CBR) are highlighted in green, blue,\nand red, respectively. 6THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D\nfor brevity. However, we observe that utilising all predictions fromΦt−1 introduces noisy or\nincorrect labels, which degrade overall performance. To mitigate this, we select the top-K\nmost confident instance predictions, denoted as ˜Yt\nK, and concatenate them with the ground-\ntruth labels of the current task to obtain the supervision set: ¯Yt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt\nK. Following this,\nthe loss is computed over both the current task’s ground-truth labels and the top-Kconfi-\ndent pseudo-labels from earlier phases, enabling the model to retain prior knowledge while\nadapting to new classes. Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR).While ER and PLG contribute to preserving prior\nknowledge, we observe that the model’s predictions are biased towards frequent classes,\nresulting in the forgetting of rare categories. This issue is further amplified by the top-K\npseudo-labels selected by PLG, which predominantly represent dominant classes in the data. To address this, we propose aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) scheme that compensates\nfor class imbalance using object frequency statistics. At taskt, only the current datasetD t\nand its label distributionp t (c)over classesc∈ Ct are available. Datasets and class distribu-\ntions from earlier tasks{D i,p i(c)}t−1\ni=1 are no longer accessible, which makes it challenging\nto directly account for class imbalance across all previously seen tasks. Therefore, we pro-\npose to leverage the pseudo-label predictions of the frozen modelΦ t−1 as a proxy for the\nclass distribution across previously learned categories. During each training iteration, the previous modelΦ t−1 is applied to the current inputP\nto generate pseudo-labels ˜Yt , from which we accumulate class-wise frequency statistics for\npreviously learned classes. LetC1:t = St\ni=1 Ci represent the union of all classes seen up to task\nt. At the end of each epoch, we compute the overall class frequencyf∈R |C1:t | by combining\nthe pseudo-label distribution ˜pt (c)derived from ˜Yt with the ground-truth label distribution\npt (c)from the current task. The resulting frequency vectorf= [f(c)] c∈C1:t is then used to\ncompute class-wise weightsw= [w(c)] c∈C1:t , which guide balanced pseudo-label selection\nand help the model focus on rare classes. In the next epoch, the modelΦ t−1 produces soft pseudo-label predictions ˜Yt (as de-\nscribed in PLG) , where each component ˜Yt [c]denotes the confidence score for classc∈\nC1:t−1. To promote balanced pseudo-label selection, class-wise re-weighting is applied using\nw(c) = 1\nf(c)+ε , whereεis a small constant for numerical stability. The adjusted predictions\nare computed by applying the class-wise weights as: ˜Yt,w [c] =w(c)· ˜Yt [c],∀c∈ C 1:t−1. Top-Kselection is then applied to both the original and the re-weighted scores, yielding\ntwo pseudo-label sets: ˜Yt\nK and ˜Yt,w\nK , respectively. The final augmented target set, Yt , is\nconstructed by concatenating the ground-truth labelsY t with both sets of pseudo-labels:\nYt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt\nK ∥ ˜Yt,w\nK .(2)\nAlthough the above re-weighting mitigates bias from prior tasks, it does not address class\nimbalance within the current taskt. To resolve this, the class-balanced weightsw c are ex-\ntended to incorporate statistics from both previously seen and current classes, i.e., overC 1:t\nrather than onlyC 1:t−1. The updated weights, denoted asw ′\nc, are used to re-weights both\npseudo-label selection and classification loss, ensuring balanced supervision across all seen\ncategories, including rare ones. This unified strategy reduces bias and enhances performance\nacross phases. The pseudo-code for constructing the supervision set in Eq. (2), which incor-\nporates both PLG and CBR components, is provided in Appendix A.

The results clearly demonstrate that our model\nconsistently retains knowledge of previous tasks better than the baseline. ForSplit-A, our\nmodel shows improvement throughout the phase. In Phase 3 of (s2), although both the base-\nline and our method exhibit a performance drop, our method reduces forgetting significantly\ncompared to the baseline.

The results clearly demonstrate that our model\nconsistently retains knowledge of previous tasks better than the baseline. ForSplit-A, our\nmodel shows improvement throughout the phase. In Phase 3 of (s2), although both the base-\nline and our method exhibit a performance drop, our method reduces forgetting significantly\ncompared to the baseline. TheSplit-Bscenario, while more complex thanSplit-A, achieves\ncomparable results due to semantic similarity among classes within the same task. In Phase\n2, our model achieves overall all 43.13% mAP50 compared to 24.53% on baseline, a similar\ntrend is observed in Phase 3, where our method not only consistently improves learning but\nalso enhances retention of previous information. After all three tasks, our method achieves\nan overall performance of 31.56% AP50, compared to 15.07% for the baseline. In theSplit-\nCscenario, the first-stage model struggles due to the increased complexity introduced by\nrandom grouping. In Phase 2, while the baseline focuses on learning the current task, it suf-\nfers from severe forgetting of prior knowledge. Conversely, our method balances new task\nlearning with the retention of earlier information.

However, this assumption is unrealistic in dynamic, real-world environments where new\nclasses emerge gradually and exhibit natural imbalance. Although some approaches ad-\ndress the emergence of new classes, they often overlook class imbalance, which leads\nto suboptimal performance, particularly on rare categories. To tackle this, we propose\nCLIMB-3D, a unified framework forCLass-incrementalImbalance-aware3DIS. Build-\ning upon established exemplar replay (ER) strategies, we show that ER alone is insuf-\nficient to achieve robust performance under memory constraints. To mitigate this, we\nintroduce a novel pseudo-label generator (PLG) that extends supervision to previously\nlearned categories by leveraging predictions from a frozen model trained on prior tasks. Despite its promise, PLG tends to be biased towards frequent classes. Therefore, we\npropose a class-balanced re-weighting (CBR) scheme that estimates object frequencies\nfrom pseudo-labels and dynamically adjusts training bias, without requiring access to\npast data. We design and evaluate three incremental scenarios for 3DIS on the challeng-\ning ScanNet200 dataset and additionally validate our method for semantic segmentation\non ScanNetV2. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing prior work by\nup to 16.76% mAP for instance segmentation and approximately 30% mIoU for semantic\nsegmentation, demonstrating strong generalisation across both frequent and rare classes.

The results clearly demonstrate that our model\nconsistently retains knowledge of previous tasks better than the baseline. ForSplit-A, our\nmodel shows improvement throughout the phase. In Phase 3 of (s2), although both the base-\nline and our method exhibit a performance drop, our method reduces forgetting significantly\ncompared to the baseline. TheSplit-Bscenario, while more complex thanSplit-A, achieves\ncomparable results due to semantic similarity among classes within the same task.

After all three tasks, our method achieves\nan overall performance of 31.56% AP50, compared to 15.07% for the baseline.

Overall, our proposed\nmethod improves mAP by 5.6%. In this supplementary material, we first demonstrate the performance gains on rare classes\nachieved by incorporating the IC module in Appendix C. Next, we provide detailed split in-\nformation for all scenarios, based on class names, in Appendix D. Finally, we present a qual-\nitative comparison between the baseline method and our proposed approach in Appendix\nE. Appendix C Evaluation on Rare Categories\nThe proposed imbalance correction (IC) module, as detailed in Section 4.2, is designed to\naddress the performance gap for rare classes. To assess its impact, we compare its perfor-\nmance with the framework which has exemplar replay (ER) and knowledge distillation (KD). Specifically, we focus on its ability to improve performance for rare classes, which the model\nencounters infrequently compared to more common classes. The results, shown in Tab.\n\n5 and Tab. 6, correspond to evaluations onSplit-AforPhase\n2andPhase 3, respectively. InPhase 2, we evaluate classes seen 1–20 times per epoch,\nwhilePhase 3targets even less frequent classes, with observations limited to 1–10 times per\nepoch. As illustrated in Tab. 5, the IC module substantially improves performance on rare\nclasses in terms of mAP 50 in Phase 2 ofSplit-A. For instance, classes likerecycling\nbinandtrash bin, seen only 3 and 7 times, respectively, shows significant improvement\nwhen the IC module is applied. Overall, the IC module provides an average boost of 8.32%,\nhighlighting its effectiveness in mitigating class imbalance. Similarly, Tab. 6 presents results forPhase 3, demonstrating significant gains for infre-\nquent classes. For example, even though the classes such aspiano,bucket, andlaundry\nbasketare observed only once, IC module improves the performance by 52.30%, 10.40%,\nand 13.60%, respectively. The ER+KD module does not focus on rare classes likeshower\nandtoasterwhich results in low performance, but the IC module compensates for this imbal-\nance by focusing on underrepresented categories.

Fig. 4 illustrates the results on theSplit-Aevaluation after learning all\ntasks, comparing the performance of the baseline method and our proposed approach. As\nshown in the figure, our method demonstrates superior instance segmentation performance\ncompared to the baseline.

After every phase, the model must recognise both newly added\nand previously learned classes. For instance, in Task 2, categories such asPillow,Coffee\nTable, andSofa Chairare introduced, while the model is expected to retain recognition\nof earlier classes likeTable,Chair, andCouch. 3D instance segmentation (3DIS) is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves\nidentifying precise object boundaries and class labels in 3D space, with broad applications in\ngraphics, robotics, and augmented reality [4, 39]. Traditional 3DIS methods, including top-\ndown [28, 70, 78], bottom-up [26, 73], and transformer-based approaches [59], perform well\nunder the assumption that all classes are available and balanced during training. However,\nthis assumption does not hold in real-world environments, where new object classes emerge\nover time and exhibit natural imbalance. This gap motivates the need for Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) [17, 54], which sup-\nports learning new categories while retaining knowledge of previous ones [51]. While CIL\nhas seen success in 2D image tasks [1, 43, 54, 60], extensions to 3D point clouds remain\nlimited, often focusing on object-level classification [13, 18, 48]. Recent works on scene-\nlevel class-incremental 3DIS (CI-3DIS) [4] and class-incremental semantic segmentation\n(CI-3DSS) [74] show promise, but depend heavily on large exemplar [56] and overlook class\nimbalance, limiting their practicality. To address this, we proposeCLIMB-3D, a unified framework forCLass-incremental\nIMBalance-aware3DIS that jointly tackles catastrophic forgetting and class imbalance. The\nframework begins with Exemplar Replay (ER), storing a small number of samples from\npast classes for later replay. However, this alone does not yield promising results under the\nstrict memory constraints required in CI-3DIS. To address this, we introduce a Pseudo-Label\nGenerator (PLG), which uses a frozen model from previous task to generate supervision for\nearlier classes. However, we observed that PLG tends to favour frequent classes while ig-\nnoring under-represented ones. To mitigate this, we propose a Class-Balanced Re-weighting\n(CBR), which estimates class frequencies from the pseudo-labels to enhance the learning of\nrare classes without accessing past data. Together, these components form a practical and\neffective solution for real-world 3DIS. To evaluate CLIMB-3D, we designed three benchmark scenarios for CI-3DIS based on\nthe ScanNet200 dataset [57]. These scenarios simulate incremental learning setup under nat-\nural class imbalance, where new classes emerge based on (A) object frequency, (B) semantic\nsimilarity, or (C) random grouping. Additionally, for comparison with existing methods,\nwe evaluate our approach on CI-3DSS using the ScanNetV2 dataset [16]. Experimental re-\nsults show that our method significantly reduces forgetting and improves performance across\nboth frequent and rare categories, outperforming previous methods in both settings. Fig. 1\nillustrates the CI-3DIS setup. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D3\nIn summary, our contributions are: (i) a novel problem setting of imbalanced class-\nincremental 3DIS with an effective method to balance learning and mitigate forgetting; (ii)\nthree benchmarks modelling continual object emergence with natural imbalance; and (iii)\nstrong experimental results, achieving up to 16.76% mAP improvement over baselines. 2 Related Work\n3D Instance Segmentation.Various methods have been proposed for 3DIS. Grouping-\nbased approaches adopt a bottom-up pipeline that learns latent embeddings for point cluster-\ning [9, 21, 22, 29, 37, 44, 70, 78]. In contrast, proposal-based methods follow a top-down\nstrategy by detecting 3D boxes and segmenting objects within them [19, 26, 46, 73, 76]. Recently, transformer-based models [68] have also been applied to 3DIS and 3DSS [59, 64],\ninspired by advances in 2D vision [10, 11]. However, these approaches require full anno-\ntations for all classes and are not designed for progressive learning, where only new class\nannotations are available and previous data is inaccessible. Another line of work aims to re-\nduce annotation costs by proposing weakly supervised 3DIS methods based on sparse cues\n[12, 27, 72]. While effective with limited annotations, these methods assume a fixed set of\nclasses and are susceptible to catastrophic forgetting in incremental settings. Incremental Learning.Continual learning involves training models sequentially to miti-\ngate catastrophic forgetting. One common strategy is model regularisation, which constrains\nparameter updates using techniques such as elastic weight consolidation or knowledge dis-\ntillation [1, 24, 35, 43, 60]. Another approach is exemplar replay, where past data is stored\nor generated to rehearse older tasks while learning new ones [5, 7, 30, 54]. A third direc-\ntion involves dynamically expanding the model architecture or using modular sub-networks\nto accommodate new tasks without interfering with old ones [31, 42, 53, 58, 71, 79]. Re-\ncent efforts in class-incremental 3D segmentation [63, 74] have shown early promise but\noften rely on basic architectures and focus primarily on semantic segmentation. Other works\n[4, 36] explore continual learning in 3D settings, though they often depend on large memory\nbuffers. In contrast, our work introduces a tailored framework for 3D instance segmentation\nthat effectively transfers knowledge across tasks, even under class imbalance. Long-tailed Recognition.Imbalanced class distributions lead to poor recognition of rare\n(long-tail) classes. To address this, re-sampling methods balance the data via input [8, 20, 50,\n52, 61] or feature space [3, 14, 40], avoiding naïve under-/over-sampling. Loss re-weighting\noffers another direction, using class-based [6, 15, 23, 32, 33, 69] or per-example [45, 55, 62]\nadjustments to ensure fair contribution. Parameter regularisation improves generalisation\nthrough weight constraints [2], albeit requiring careful tuning. Other approaches leverage\ntransfer learning [77, 81], self-supervision [41, 75], or contrastive learning [34, 41, 82] to\nimprove rare-class representations. Long-tailed recognition is well-studied in 2D with large-\nscale datasets [15, 49, 67]; in 3D, ScanNet200 [16, 57] enables similar efforts. Prior 3D\nwork focused on re-weighting, re-sampling, and transfer learning [57], while regularisation\nremains underexplored. CeCo [80] balances class centres via auxiliary loss but overlooks\nsampling and augmentation. Lahoud et al. [38] propose adaptive classifier regularisation\nfor 3D segmentation, outperforming prior approaches without threshold tuning. However,\nneither method considers incremental learning. In contrast, we jointly address long-tail and\ncontinual 3D semantic segmentation. 4THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D\nFeature \nBackbone\nTransformer \nDecoder\nFeature \nBackbone\nTransformer \nDecoder\n(𝑷,𝒀𝑡)\nCurrent model (𝛷\n𝑡\n)\nPseudo Label Generator (PLG) \nSelection\n෨𝑌𝐾\n𝑡\nℒCI−3DIS\n෨𝑌𝐾\n𝑡,𝑤\nത𝑌𝐾\n𝑡\n෠𝑌𝑡\n(𝐷𝑡)\nCurrent Dataset \nExemplar \nReplay (ER)\n+\n~\nClass-Balanced  \nRe-weighting \n(CBR)\n1\n𝑓(𝑐)\nFigure 2: Overview ofCLIMB-3Dfor CI-3DIS.

During taskt, point cloudsPand their corresponding labelsY t are\nsampled from a combination of the current training datasetD t and Exemplar Replay (ER),\nwhich maintains a small memory of past examples. These are then passed to the current\nmodelΦ t to produce predicted labelsY t . The Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG) selects the\ntop-Kpredictions from the previous modelΦ t−1 . These pseudo-labels are then weighted\nbased on class frequencyf(c)using Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR), and the top-Kre-\nweighted labels are selected to form the balanced pseudo-label set ¯Yt . This pseudo-label set\nis then concatenated with the ground-truth labels to form a final augmented supervision set\nYt for taskt, which is used to optimise the modelΦ t using Eq. (3). 3 Methodology\n3.1 Problem Formulation\n3DIS.The objective of this task is to detect and segment each object instance within a point\ncloud. Formally, the training dataset is denoted asD={(P i,Yi)}N\ni=1, whereNis the number\nof training samples. Each inputP i ∈R M×6 is a coloured point cloud consisting ofMpoints,\nwhere each point is represented by its 3D coordinates and RGB values. The corresponding\nannotationY i ={(m i,j ,ci,j )}Ji\nj=1 containsJ i object instances, wheremi,j ∈ {0,1}M is a binary\nmask indicating which points belong to thej-th instance, andc i,j ∈ C={1,...,C}is the\nsemantic class label of that instance. GivenP i, the modelΦpredicts instance-level outputs\nˆYi ={(ˆmi,j ,ˆci,j )}\nˆJi\nj=1, where ˆmi,j and ˆci,j denote the predicted mask and category label for\nthej-th instance, respectively. The number of predicted instances ˆJi varies depending on the\nmodel’s inference. The model is optimised using the following objective:\nL3DIS(D;Φ) = 1\n|D| ∑\n(P,Y)∈D\n1\n|Y| ∑\n(mj,cj)∈Y\n(Lmask(mj,ˆmj)+λ·L cls(cj,ˆcj)),(1)\nwhereL cls andL mask are the average classification and mask losses over all instances, andλ\ncontrols their trade-off. CI-3DIS.Unlike conventional 3DIS, CI-3DIS involves sequential learning, where object\ncategories are introduced incrementally overTtraining tasks. Each tasktintroduces a dis-\njoint set of classesC t , withC= ST\nt=1 Ct andC t ∩C t′\n=/ 0 fort̸=t ′. During each taskt, the THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D5\nmodel receives a datasetD t ={(P i,Yt\ni)}N\ni=1, where each coloured point cloudP i ∈R M×6\ncontainsMpoints, and the corresponding annotationY t\ni ={(m t\ni,j ,ct\ni,j )}\nJt\ni\nj=1 includes instance\nmasksm t\ni,j ∈ {0,1}M and semantic class labelsc t\ni,j ∈ Ct . The modelΦ t , initialized from\nΦt−1 , is trained onD t to predict instance-level outputs ˆYt\ni ={(ˆmt\ni,j ,ˆct\ni,j )}\nˆJt\ni\nj=1, where each\npredicted semantic label ˆct\ni,j belongs to the cumulative set of all classes observed so far:St\nk=1 Ck. The key challenge in this setup is to learn new classes without forgetting those\nencountered in previous tasks, despite limited supervision and the absence of past labels. 3.2 Method: CLIMB-3D\nOverview.As shown in Fig. 2 and formulated in Sec. 3.1, the proposed framework for\nCI-3DIS follows aphase-wisetraining strategy. In each phase, the model is exposed to a\ncarefully curated subset of the dataset, simulating real-world scenarios discussed in Sec. 3.3. Training naïvely on such phased data leads tocatastrophic forgetting[51], where the model\nforgets prior knowledge when learning new tasks. To address this, we first incorporateEx-\nemplar Replay(ER) [5], a strategy inspired by 2D incremental methods [1, 43, 54] and\nrecently extended to 3D settings [4], to mitigate forgetting by storing a small set of repre-\nsentative samples from earlier phases. However, ER alone is insufficient to achieve robust\nperformance. To address this, two additional components are introduced: aPseudo-Label\nGenerator(PLG), which leverages a frozen model to generate supervision signals for previ-\nously seen classes, and aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) module that compensates for\nclass imbalance across phases. Each of these components is described in detail below 1. Exemplar Replay (ER).Inspired by Buzzega et al. [5], ER addresses the issue of catas-\ntrophic forgetting by allowing the model to retain a subset of data from earlier phases. During phaset, the model is trained not only on the current task dataD t , but also on a\nset of exemplarsE 1:t−1, collected from previous phases. These exemplars are accumulated\nincrementally:E 1:t−1 =E 1 ∪···∪E t−1 .Here,E t denotes the exemplar subset stored after\nphaset, and|E t |denotes the exemplar replay size. The combined replay dataset is denoted\nas:D t\nER =D t ∪E 1:t−1.Epoch training consists of two stages: first, the model is trained on\nthe current data,D t ; then it is trained using exemplars fromE 1:t−1. While previous CI-3DIS approaches rely on large exemplar sets to mitigate forgetting [4],\nsuch strategies become impractical under memory constraints. Consequently, although ER\naids knowledge retention, it is insufficient on its own for robust performance with a limited\nexemplar budget. Therefore, PLG and CBR are introduced to better preserve past represen-\ntations and enhance generalisation across phases. Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG).In the CI-3DIS setting, during phaset(wheret>1),\nalthough ground-truth labels for previously seen classes are unavailable, the model from the\nprevious phaseΦ t−1 , which preserves knowledge of past tasks, is retained. We use this\nmodel to generate pseudo-labels for previously seen classes, thereby providing approximate\nsupervision during training. This allows the current modelΦt , to retain prior knowledge and\nreduce forgetting, even without access to ground-truth annotations. Given a point cloud and label pair(P,Y t ), fromD t , the previous modelΦ t−1 , generates\npseudo-labels for the previously seen classes as ˆY1:t−1 =Φ t−1 (P), which we denote as ˜Yt\n1For clarity, modifications introduced by each component (ER, PLG, and CBR) are highlighted in green, blue,\nand red, respectively. 6THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D\nfor brevity. However, we observe that utilising all predictions fromΦt−1 introduces noisy or\nincorrect labels, which degrade overall performance. To mitigate this, we select the top-K\nmost confident instance predictions, denoted as ˜Yt\nK, and concatenate them with the ground-\ntruth labels of the current task to obtain the supervision set: ¯Yt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt\nK. Following this,\nthe loss is computed over both the current task’s ground-truth labels and the top-Kconfi-\ndent pseudo-labels from earlier phases, enabling the model to retain prior knowledge while\nadapting to new classes. Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR).While ER and PLG contribute to preserving prior\nknowledge, we observe that the model’s predictions are biased towards frequent classes,\nresulting in the forgetting of rare categories. This issue is further amplified by the top-K\npseudo-labels selected by PLG, which predominantly represent dominant classes in the data. To address this, we propose aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) scheme that compensates\nfor class imbalance using object frequency statistics. At taskt, only the current datasetD t\nand its label distributionp t (c)over classesc∈ Ct are available. Datasets and class distribu-\ntions from earlier tasks{D i,p i(c)}t−1\ni=1 are no longer accessible, which makes it challenging\nto directly account for class imbalance across all previously seen tasks. Therefore, we pro-\npose to leverage the pseudo-label predictions of the frozen modelΦ t−1 as a proxy for the\nclass distribution across previously learned categories. During each training iteration, the previous modelΦ t−1 is applied to the current inputP\nto generate pseudo-labels ˜Yt , from which we accumulate class-wise frequency statistics for\npreviously learned classes. LetC1:t = St\ni=1 Ci represent the union of all classes seen up to task\nt. At the end of each epoch, we compute the overall class frequencyf∈R |C1:t | by combining\nthe pseudo-label distribution ˜pt (c)derived from ˜Yt with the ground-truth label distribution\npt (c)from the current task. The resulting frequency vectorf= [f(c)] c∈C1:t is then used to\ncompute class-wise weightsw= [w(c)] c∈C1:t , which guide balanced pseudo-label selection\nand help the model focus on rare classes. In the next epoch, the modelΦ t−1 produces soft pseudo-label predictions ˜Yt (as de-\nscribed in PLG) , where each component ˜Yt [c]denotes the confidence score for classc∈\nC1:t−1. To promote balanced pseudo-label selection, class-wise re-weighting is applied using\nw(c) = 1\nf(c)+ε , whereεis a small constant for numerical stability. The adjusted predictions\nare computed by applying the class-wise weights as: ˜Yt,w [c] =w(c)· ˜Yt [c],∀c∈ C 1:t−1. Top-Kselection is then applied to both the original and the re-weighted scores, yielding\ntwo pseudo-label sets: ˜Yt\nK and ˜Yt,w\nK , respectively. The final augmented target set, Yt , is\nconstructed by concatenating the ground-truth labelsY t with both sets of pseudo-labels:\nYt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt\nK ∥ ˜Yt,w\nK .(2)\nAlthough the above re-weighting mitigates bias from prior tasks, it does not address class\nimbalance within the current taskt. To resolve this, the class-balanced weightsw c are ex-\ntended to incorporate statistics from both previously seen and current classes, i.e., overC 1:t\nrather than onlyC 1:t−1. The updated weights, denoted asw ′\nc, are used to re-weights both\npseudo-label selection and classification loss, ensuring balanced supervision across all seen\ncategories, including rare ones. This unified strategy reduces bias and enhances performance\nacross phases. The pseudo-code for constructing the supervision set in Eq. (2), which incor-\nporates both PLG and CBR components, is provided in Appendix A.

After every phase, the model must recognise both newly added\nand previously learned classes. For instance, in Task 2, categories such asPillow,Coffee\nTable, andSofa Chairare introduced, while the model is expected to retain recognition\nof earlier classes likeTable,Chair, andCouch. 3D instance segmentation (3DIS) is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves\nidentifying precise object boundaries and class labels in 3D space, with broad applications in\ngraphics, robotics, and augmented reality [4, 39]. Traditional 3DIS methods, including top-\ndown [28, 70, 78], bottom-up [26, 73], and transformer-based approaches [59], perform well\nunder the assumption that all classes are available and balanced during training. However,\nthis assumption does not hold in real-world environments, where new object classes emerge\nover time and exhibit natural imbalance. This gap motivates the need for Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) [17, 54], which sup-\nports learning new categories while retaining knowledge of previous ones [51]. While CIL\nhas seen success in 2D image tasks [1, 43, 54, 60], extensions to 3D point clouds remain\nlimited, often focusing on object-level classification [13, 18, 48]. Recent works on scene-\nlevel class-incremental 3DIS (CI-3DIS) [4] and class-incremental semantic segmentation\n(CI-3DSS) [74] show promise, but depend heavily on large exemplar [56] and overlook class\nimbalance, limiting their practicality. To address this, we proposeCLIMB-3D, a unified framework forCLass-incremental\nIMBalance-aware3DIS that jointly tackles catastrophic forgetting and class imbalance. The\nframework begins with Exemplar Replay (ER), storing a small number of samples from\npast classes for later replay. However, this alone does not yield promising results under the\nstrict memory constraints required in CI-3DIS. To address this, we introduce a Pseudo-Label\nGenerator (PLG), which uses a frozen model from previous task to generate supervision for\nearlier classes. However, we observed that PLG tends to favour frequent classes while ig-\nnoring under-represented ones. To mitigate this, we propose a Class-Balanced Re-weighting\n(CBR), which estimates class frequencies from the pseudo-labels to enhance the learning of\nrare classes without accessing past data. Together, these components form a practical and\neffective solution for real-world 3DIS. To evaluate CLIMB-3D, we designed three benchmark scenarios for CI-3DIS based on\nthe ScanNet200 dataset [57]. These scenarios simulate incremental learning setup under nat-\nural class imbalance, where new classes emerge based on (A) object frequency, (B) semantic\nsimilarity, or (C) random grouping. Additionally, for comparison with existing methods,\nwe evaluate our approach on CI-3DSS using the ScanNetV2 dataset [16]. Experimental re-\nsults show that our method significantly reduces forgetting and improves performance across\nboth frequent and rare categories, outperforming previous methods in both settings. Fig. 1\nillustrates the CI-3DIS setup. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D3\nIn summary, our contributions are: (i) a novel problem setting of imbalanced class-\nincremental 3DIS with an effective method to balance learning and mitigate forgetting; (ii)\nthree benchmarks modelling continual object emergence with natural imbalance; and (iii)\nstrong experimental results, achieving up to 16.76% mAP improvement over baselines. 2 Related Work\n3D Instance Segmentation.Various methods have been proposed for 3DIS. Grouping-\nbased approaches adopt a bottom-up pipeline that learns latent embeddings for point cluster-\ning [9, 21, 22, 29, 37, 44, 70, 78]. In contrast, proposal-based methods follow a top-down\nstrategy by detecting 3D boxes and segmenting objects within them [19, 26, 46, 73, 76]. Recently, transformer-based models [68] have also been applied to 3DIS and 3DSS [59, 64],\ninspired by advances in 2D vision [10, 11]. However, these approaches require full anno-\ntations for all classes and are not designed for progressive learning, where only new class\nannotations are available and previous data is inaccessible. Another line of work aims to re-\nduce annotation costs by proposing weakly supervised 3DIS methods based on sparse cues\n[12, 27, 72]. While effective with limited annotations, these methods assume a fixed set of\nclasses and are susceptible to catastrophic forgetting in incremental settings. Incremental Learning.Continual learning involves training models sequentially to miti-\ngate catastrophic forgetting. One common strategy is model regularisation, which constrains\nparameter updates using techniques such as elastic weight consolidation or knowledge dis-\ntillation [1, 24, 35, 43, 60]. Another approach is exemplar replay, where past data is stored\nor generated to rehearse older tasks while learning new ones [5, 7, 30, 54]. A third direc-\ntion involves dynamically expanding the model architecture or using modular sub-networks\nto accommodate new tasks without interfering with old ones [31, 42, 53, 58, 71, 79]. Re-\ncent efforts in class-incremental 3D segmentation [63, 74] have shown early promise but\noften rely on basic architectures and focus primarily on semantic segmentation. Other works\n[4, 36] explore continual learning in 3D settings, though they often depend on large memory\nbuffers. In contrast, our work introduces a tailored framework for 3D instance segmentation\nthat effectively transfers knowledge across tasks, even under class imbalance. Long-tailed Recognition.Imbalanced class distributions lead to poor recognition of rare\n(long-tail) classes. To address this, re-sampling methods balance the data via input [8, 20, 50,\n52, 61] or feature space [3, 14, 40], avoiding naïve under-/over-sampling. Loss re-weighting\noffers another direction, using class-based [6, 15, 23, 32, 33, 69] or per-example [45, 55, 62]\nadjustments to ensure fair contribution. Parameter regularisation improves generalisation\nthrough weight constraints [2], albeit requiring careful tuning. Other approaches leverage\ntransfer learning [77, 81], self-supervision [41, 75], or contrastive learning [34, 41, 82] to\nimprove rare-class representations. Long-tailed recognition is well-studied in 2D with large-\nscale datasets [15, 49, 67]; in 3D, ScanNet200 [16, 57] enables similar efforts. Prior 3D\nwork focused on re-weighting, re-sampling, and transfer learning [57], while regularisation\nremains underexplored. CeCo [80] balances class centres via auxiliary loss but overlooks\nsampling and augmentation. Lahoud et al. [38] propose adaptive classifier regularisation\nfor 3D segmentation, outperforming prior approaches without threshold tuning. However,\nneither method considers incremental learning. In contrast, we jointly address long-tail and\ncontinual 3D semantic segmentation. 4THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D\nFeature \nBackbone\nTransformer \nDecoder\nFeature \nBackbone\nTransformer \nDecoder\n(𝑷,𝒀𝑡)\nCurrent model (𝛷\n𝑡\n)\nPseudo Label Generator (PLG) \nSelection\n෨𝑌𝐾\n𝑡\nℒCI−3DIS\n෨𝑌𝐾\n𝑡,𝑤\nത𝑌𝐾\n𝑡\n෠𝑌𝑡\n(𝐷𝑡)\nCurrent Dataset \nExemplar \nReplay (ER)\n+\n~\nClass-Balanced  \nRe-weighting \n(CBR)\n1\n𝑓(𝑐)\nFigure 2: Overview ofCLIMB-3Dfor CI-3DIS.

Formally, the training dataset is denoted asD={(P i,Yi)}N\ni=1, whereNis the number\nof training samples. Each inputP i ∈R M×6 is a coloured point cloud consisting ofMpoints,\nwhere each point is represented by its 3D coordinates and RGB values. The corresponding\nannotationY i ={(m i,j ,ci,j )}Ji\nj=1 containsJ i object instances, wheremi,j ∈ {0,1}M is a binary\nmask indicating which points belong to thej-th instance, andc i,j ∈ C={1,...,C}is the\nsemantic class label of that instance. GivenP i, the modelΦpredicts instance-level outputs\nˆYi ={(ˆmi,j ,ˆci,j )}\nˆJi\nj=1, where ˆmi,j and ˆci,j denote the predicted mask and category label for\nthej-th instance, respectively. The number of predicted instances ˆJi varies depending on the\nmodel’s inference. The model is optimised using the following objective:\nL3DIS(D;Φ) = 1\n|D| ∑\n(P,Y)∈D\n1\n|Y| ∑\n(mj,cj)∈Y\n(Lmask(mj,ˆmj)+λ·L cls(cj,ˆcj)),(1)\nwhereL cls andL mask are the average classification and mask losses over all instances, andλ\ncontrols their trade-off. CI-3DIS.Unlike conventional 3DIS, CI-3DIS involves sequential learning, where object\ncategories are introduced incrementally overTtraining tasks. Each tasktintroduces a dis-\njoint set of classesC t , withC= ST\nt=1 Ct andC t ∩C t′\n=/ 0 fort̸=t ′. During each taskt, the THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D5\nmodel receives a datasetD t ={(P i,Yt\ni)}N\ni=1, where each coloured point cloudP i ∈R M×6\ncontainsMpoints, and the corresponding annotationY t\ni ={(m t\ni,j ,ct\ni,j )}\nJt\ni\nj=1 includes instance\nmasksm t\ni,j ∈ {0,1}M and semantic class labelsc t\ni,j ∈ Ct . The modelΦ t , initialized from\nΦt−1 , is trained onD t to predict instance-level outputs ˆYt\ni ={(ˆmt\ni,j ,ˆct\ni,j )}\nˆJt\ni\nj=1, where each\npredicted semantic label ˆct\ni,j belongs to the cumulative set of all classes observed so far:St\nk=1 Ck. The key challenge in this setup is to learn new classes without forgetting those\nencountered in previous tasks, despite limited supervision and the absence of past labels. 3.2 Method: CLIMB-3D\nOverview.As shown in Fig. 2 and formulated in Sec. 3.1, the proposed framework for\nCI-3DIS follows aphase-wisetraining strategy. In each phase, the model is exposed to a\ncarefully curated subset of the dataset, simulating real-world scenarios discussed in Sec. 3.3. Training naïvely on such phased data leads tocatastrophic forgetting[51], where the model\nforgets prior knowledge when learning new tasks. To address this, we first incorporateEx-\nemplar Replay(ER) [5], a strategy inspired by 2D incremental methods [1, 43, 54] and\nrecently extended to 3D settings [4], to mitigate forgetting by storing a small set of repre-\nsentative samples from earlier phases. However, ER alone is insufficient to achieve robust\nperformance. To address this, two additional components are introduced: aPseudo-Label\nGenerator(PLG), which leverages a frozen model to generate supervision signals for previ-\nously seen classes, and aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) module that compensates for\nclass imbalance across phases. Each of these components is described in detail below 1. Exemplar Replay (ER).Inspired by Buzzega et al. [5], ER addresses the issue of catas-\ntrophic forgetting by allowing the model to retain a subset of data from earlier phases. During phaset, the model is trained not only on the current task dataD t , but also on a\nset of exemplarsE 1:t−1, collected from previous phases. These exemplars are accumulated\nincrementally:E 1:t−1 =E 1 ∪···∪E t−1 .Here,E t denotes the exemplar subset stored after\nphaset, and|E t |denotes the exemplar replay size. The combined replay dataset is denoted\nas:D t\nER =D t ∪E 1:t−1.Epoch training consists of two stages: first, the model is trained on\nthe current data,D t ; then it is trained using exemplars fromE 1:t−1. While previous CI-3DIS approaches rely on large exemplar sets to mitigate forgetting [4],\nsuch strategies become impractical under memory constraints. Consequently, although ER\naids knowledge retention, it is insufficient on its own for robust performance with a limited\nexemplar budget. Therefore, PLG and CBR are introduced to better preserve past represen-\ntations and enhance generalisation across phases. Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG).In the CI-3DIS setting, during phaset(wheret>1),\nalthough ground-truth labels for previously seen classes are unavailable, the model from the\nprevious phaseΦ t−1 , which preserves knowledge of past tasks, is retained. We use this\nmodel to generate pseudo-labels for previously seen classes, thereby providing approximate\nsupervision during training. This allows the current modelΦt , to retain prior knowledge and\nreduce forgetting, even without access to ground-truth annotations. Given a point cloud and label pair(P,Y t ), fromD t , the previous modelΦ t−1 , generates\npseudo-labels for the previously seen classes as ˆY1:t−1 =Φ t−1 (P), which we denote as ˜Yt\n1For clarity, modifications introduced by each component (ER, PLG, and CBR) are highlighted in green, blue,\nand red, respectively. 6THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D\nfor brevity. However, we observe that utilising all predictions fromΦt−1 introduces noisy or\nincorrect labels, which degrade overall performance. To mitigate this, we select the top-K\nmost confident instance predictions, denoted as ˜Yt\nK, and concatenate them with the ground-\ntruth labels of the current task to obtain the supervision set: ¯Yt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt\nK. Following this,\nthe loss is computed over both the current task’s ground-truth labels and the top-Kconfi-\ndent pseudo-labels from earlier phases, enabling the model to retain prior knowledge while\nadapting to new classes. Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR).While ER and PLG contribute to preserving prior\nknowledge, we observe that the model’s predictions are biased towards frequent classes,\nresulting in the forgetting of rare categories. This issue is further amplified by the top-K\npseudo-labels selected by PLG, which predominantly represent dominant classes in the data. To address this, we propose aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) scheme that compensates\nfor class imbalance using object frequency statistics. At taskt, only the current datasetD t\nand its label distributionp t (c)over classesc∈ Ct are available. Datasets and class distribu-\ntions from earlier tasks{D i,p i(c)}t−1\ni=1 are no longer accessible, which makes it challenging\nto directly account for class imbalance across all previously seen tasks. Therefore, we pro-\npose to leverage the pseudo-label predictions of the frozen modelΦ t−1 as a proxy for the\nclass distribution across previously learned categories. During each training iteration, the previous modelΦ t−1 is applied to the current inputP\nto generate pseudo-labels ˜Yt , from which we accumulate class-wise frequency statistics for\npreviously learned classes. LetC1:t = St\ni=1 Ci represent the union of all classes seen up to task\nt. At the end of each epoch, we compute the overall class frequencyf∈R |C1:t | by combining\nthe pseudo-label distribution ˜pt (c)derived from ˜Yt with the ground-truth label distribution\npt (c)from the current task. The resulting frequency vectorf= [f(c)] c∈C1:t is then used to\ncompute class-wise weightsw= [w(c)] c∈C1:t , which guide balanced pseudo-label selection\nand help the model focus on rare classes. In the next epoch, the modelΦ t−1 produces soft pseudo-label predictions ˜Yt (as de-\nscribed in PLG) , where each component ˜Yt [c]denotes the confidence score for classc∈\nC1:t−1. To promote balanced pseudo-label selection, class-wise re-weighting is applied using\nw(c) = 1\nf(c)+ε , whereεis a small constant for numerical stability. The adjusted predictions\nare computed by applying the class-wise weights as: ˜Yt,w [c] =w(c)· ˜Yt [c],∀c∈ C 1:t−1. Top-Kselection is then applied to both the original and the re-weighted scores, yielding\ntwo pseudo-label sets: ˜Yt\nK and ˜Yt,w\nK , respectively. The final augmented target set, Yt , is\nconstructed by concatenating the ground-truth labelsY t with both sets of pseudo-labels:\nYt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt\nK ∥ ˜Yt,w\nK .(2)\nAlthough the above re-weighting mitigates bias from prior tasks, it does not address class\nimbalance within the current taskt. To resolve this, the class-balanced weightsw c are ex-\ntended to incorporate statistics from both previously seen and current classes, i.e., overC 1:t\nrather than onlyC 1:t−1. The updated weights, denoted asw ′\nc, are used to re-weights both\npseudo-label selection and classification loss, ensuring balanced supervision across all seen\ncategories, including rare ones. This unified strategy reduces bias and enhances performance\nacross phases. The pseudo-code for constructing the supervision set in Eq. (2), which incor-\nporates both PLG and CBR components, is provided in Appendix A. Final Objective.The final training objective ofCLIMB-3D, incorporating ER, PLG, and THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D7\nCBR, is formulated in Eq. (1) as:\nL(Dt\nER;Φt ) = 1\n|Dt\nER| ∑\n(P,Yt )∈Dt\nER\n1\n|Yt | ∑\n(mt\nj,ct\nj)∈Yt\n", "cot_answer": "Step 1: The paper by Yin Cui, Menglin Jia, Tsung-Yi Lin, Yang Song, and Serge Belongie characterizes the number of samples by leveraging a Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR) scheme that compensates for class imbalance using object frequency statistics.

For instance, in Task 2, categories such asPillow,Coffee\nTable, andSofa Chairare introduced, while the model is expected to retain recognition\nof earlier classes likeTable,Chair, andCouch. 3D instance segmentation (3DIS) is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves\nidentifying precise object boundaries and class labels in 3D space, with broad applications in\ngraphics, robotics, and augmented reality [4, 39]. Traditional 3DIS methods, including top-\ndown [28, 70, 78], bottom-up [26, 73], and transformer-based approaches [59], perform well\nunder the assumption that all classes are available and balanced during training. However,\nthis assumption does not hold in real-world environments, where new object classes emerge\nover time and exhibit natural imbalance. This gap motivates the need for Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) [17, 54], which sup-\nports learning new categories while retaining knowledge of previous ones [51]. While CIL\nhas seen success in 2D image tasks [1, 43, 54, 60], extensions to 3D point clouds remain\nlimited, often focusing on object-level classification [13, 18, 48]. Recent works on scene-\nlevel class-incremental 3DIS (CI-3DIS) [4] and class-incremental semantic segmentation\n(CI-3DSS) [74] show promise, but depend heavily on large exemplar [56] and overlook class\nimbalance, limiting their practicality. To address this, we proposeCLIMB-3D, a unified framework forCLass-incremental\nIMBalance-aware3DIS that jointly tackles catastrophic forgetting and class imbalance. The\nframework begins with Exemplar Replay (ER), storing a small number of samples from\npast classes for later replay. However, this alone does not yield promising results under the\nstrict memory constraints required in CI-3DIS. To address this, we introduce a Pseudo-Label\nGenerator (PLG), which uses a frozen model from previous task to generate supervision for\nearlier classes. However, we observed that PLG tends to favour frequent classes while ig-\nnoring under-represented ones. To mitigate this, we propose a Class-Balanced Re-weighting\n(CBR), which estimates class frequencies from the pseudo-labels to enhance the learning of\nrare classes without accessing past data. Together, these components form a practical and\neffective solution for real-world 3DIS. To evaluate CLIMB-3D, we designed three benchmark scenarios for CI-3DIS based on\nthe ScanNet200 dataset [57]. These scenarios simulate incremental learning setup under nat-\nural class imbalance, where new classes emerge based on (A) object frequency, (B) semantic\nsimilarity, or (C) random grouping. Additionally, for comparison with existing methods,\nwe evaluate our approach on CI-3DSS using the ScanNetV2 dataset [16]. Experimental re-\nsults show that our method significantly reduces forgetting and improves performance across\nboth frequent and rare categories, outperforming previous methods in both settings.

Grouping-\nbased approaches adopt a bottom-up pipeline that learns latent embeddings for point cluster-\ning [9, 21, 22, 29, 37, 44, 70, 78]. In contrast, proposal-based methods follow a top-down\nstrategy by detecting 3D boxes and segmenting objects within them [19, 26, 46, 73, 76]. Recently, transformer-based models [68] have also been applied to 3DIS and 3DSS [59, 64],\ninspired by advances in 2D vision [10, 11]. However, these approaches require full anno-\ntations for all classes and are not designed for progressive learning, where only new class\nannotations are available and previous data is inaccessible. Another line of work aims to re-\nduce annotation costs by proposing weakly supervised 3DIS methods based on sparse cues\n[12, 27, 72]. While effective with limited annotations, these methods assume a fixed set of\nclasses and are susceptible to catastrophic forgetting in incremental settings. Incremental Learning.Continual learning involves training models sequentially to miti-\ngate catastrophic forgetting. One common strategy is model regularisation, which constrains\nparameter updates using techniques such as elastic weight consolidation or knowledge dis-\ntillation [1, 24, 35, 43, 60]. Another approach is exemplar replay, where past data is stored\nor generated to rehearse older tasks while learning new ones [5, 7, 30, 54]. A third direc-\ntion involves dynamically expanding the model architecture or using modular sub-networks\nto accommodate new tasks without interfering with old ones [31, 42, 53, 58, 71, 79]. Re-\ncent efforts in class-incremental 3D segmentation [63, 74] have shown early promise but\noften rely on basic architectures and focus primarily on semantic segmentation. Other works\n[4, 36] explore continual learning in 3D settings, though they often depend on large memory\nbuffers. In contrast, our work introduces a tailored framework for 3D instance segmentation\nthat effectively transfers knowledge across tasks, even under class imbalance. Long-tailed Recognition.Imbalanced class distributions lead to poor recognition of rare\n(long-tail) classes. To address this, re-sampling methods balance the data via input [8, 20, 50,\n52, 61] or feature space [3, 14, 40], avoiding naïve under-/over-sampling. Loss re-weighting\noffers another direction, using class-based [6, 15, 23, 32, 33, 69] or per-example [45, 55, 62]\nadjustments to ensure fair contribution. Parameter regularisation improves generalisation\nthrough weight constraints [2], albeit requiring careful tuning. Other approaches leverage\ntransfer learning [77, 81], self-supervision [41, 75], or contrastive learning [34, 41, 82] to\nimprove rare-class representations. Long-tailed recognition is well-studied in 2D with large-\nscale datasets [15, 49, 67]; in 3D, ScanNet200 [16, 57] enables similar efforts.

This pseudo-label set\nis then concatenated with the ground-truth labels to form a final augmented supervision set\nYt for taskt, which is used to optimise the modelΦ t using Eq. (3). 3 Methodology\n3.1 Problem Formulation\n3DIS.The objective of this task is to detect and segment each object instance within a point\ncloud. Formally, the training dataset is denoted asD={(P i,Yi)}N\ni=1, whereNis the number\nof training samples. Each inputP i ∈R M×6 is a coloured point cloud consisting ofMpoints,\nwhere each point is represented by its 3D coordinates and RGB values. The corresponding\nannotationY i ={(m i,j ,ci,j )}Ji\nj=1 containsJ i object instances, wheremi,j ∈ {0,1}M is a binary\nmask indicating which points belong to thej-th instance, andc i,j ∈ C={1,...,C}is the\nsemantic class label of that instance. GivenP i, the modelΦpredicts instance-level outputs\nˆYi ={(ˆmi,j ,ˆci,j )}\nˆJi\nj=1, where ˆmi,j and ˆci,j denote the predicted mask and category label for\nthej-th instance, respectively. The number of predicted instances ˆJi varies depending on the\nmodel’s inference. The model is optimised using the following objective:\nL3DIS(D;Φ) = 1\n|D| ∑\n(P,Y)∈D\n1\n|Y| ∑\n(mj,cj)∈Y\n(Lmask(mj,ˆmj)+λ·L cls(cj,ˆcj)),(1)\nwhereL cls andL mask are the average classification and mask losses over all instances, andλ\ncontrols their trade-off. CI-3DIS.Unlike conventional 3DIS, CI-3DIS involves sequential learning, where object\ncategories are introduced incrementally overTtraining tasks. Each tasktintroduces a dis-\njoint set of classesC t , withC= ST\nt=1 Ct andC t ∩C t′\n=/ 0 fort̸=t ′. During each taskt, the THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D5\nmodel receives a datasetD t ={(P i,Yt\ni)}N\ni=1, where each coloured point cloudP i ∈R M×6\ncontainsMpoints, and the corresponding annotationY t\ni ={(m t\ni,j ,ct\ni,j )}\nJt\ni\nj=1 includes instance\nmasksm t\ni,j ∈ {0,1}M and semantic class labelsc t\ni,j ∈ Ct . The modelΦ t , initialized from\nΦt−1 , is trained onD t to predict instance-level outputs ˆYt\ni ={(ˆmt\ni,j ,ˆct\ni,j )}\nˆJt\ni\nj=1, where each\npredicted semantic label ˆct\ni,j belongs to the cumulative set of all classes observed so far:St\nk=1 Ck. The key challenge in this setup is to learn new classes without forgetting those\nencountered in previous tasks, despite limited supervision and the absence of past labels. 3.2 Method: CLIMB-3D\nOverview.As shown in Fig. 2 and formulated in Sec. 3.1, the proposed framework for\nCI-3DIS follows aphase-wisetraining strategy. In each phase, the model is exposed to a\ncarefully curated subset of the dataset, simulating real-world scenarios discussed in Sec. 3.3. Training naïvely on such phased data leads tocatastrophic forgetting[51], where the model\nforgets prior knowledge when learning new tasks. To address this, we first incorporateEx-\nemplar Replay(ER) [5], a strategy inspired by 2D incremental methods [1, 43, 54] and\nrecently extended to 3D settings [4], to mitigate forgetting by storing a small set of repre-\nsentative samples from earlier phases. However, ER alone is insufficient to achieve robust\nperformance. To address this, two additional components are introduced: aPseudo-Label\nGenerator(PLG), which leverages a frozen model to generate supervision signals for previ-\nously seen classes, and aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) module that compensates for\nclass imbalance across phases. Each of these components is described in detail below 1. Exemplar Replay (ER).Inspired by Buzzega et al. [5], ER addresses the issue of catas-\ntrophic forgetting by allowing the model to retain a subset of data from earlier phases. During phaset, the model is trained not only on the current task dataD t , but also on a\nset of exemplarsE 1:t−1, collected from previous phases. These exemplars are accumulated\nincrementally:E 1:t−1 =E 1 ∪···∪E t−1 .Here,E t denotes the exemplar subset stored after\nphaset, and|E t |denotes the exemplar replay size. The combined replay dataset is denoted\nas:D t\nER =D t ∪E 1:t−1.Epoch training consists of two stages: first, the model is trained on\nthe current data,D t ; then it is trained using exemplars fromE 1:t−1. While previous CI-3DIS approaches rely on large exemplar sets to mitigate forgetting [4],\nsuch strategies become impractical under memory constraints. Consequently, although ER\naids knowledge retention, it is insufficient on its own for robust performance with a limited\nexemplar budget. Therefore, PLG and CBR are introduced to better preserve past represen-\ntations and enhance generalisation across phases. Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG).In the CI-3DIS setting, during phaset(wheret>1),\nalthough ground-truth labels for previously seen classes are unavailable, the model from the\nprevious phaseΦ t−1 , which preserves knowledge of past tasks, is retained. We use this\nmodel to generate pseudo-labels for previously seen classes, thereby providing approximate\nsupervision during training. This allows the current modelΦt , to retain prior knowledge and\nreduce forgetting, even without access to ground-truth annotations. Given a point cloud and label pair(P,Y t ), fromD t , the previous modelΦ t−1 , generates\npseudo-labels for the previously seen classes as ˆY1:t−1 =Φ t−1 (P), which we denote as ˜Yt\n1For clarity, modifications introduced by each component (ER, PLG, and CBR) are highlighted in green, blue,\nand red, respectively. 6THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D\nfor brevity. However, we observe that utilising all predictions fromΦt−1 introduces noisy or\nincorrect labels, which degrade overall performance. To mitigate this, we select the top-K\nmost confident instance predictions, denoted as ˜Yt\nK, and concatenate them with the ground-\ntruth labels of the current task to obtain the supervision set: ¯Yt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt\nK. Following this,\nthe loss is computed over both the current task’s ground-truth labels and the top-Kconfi-\ndent pseudo-labels from earlier phases, enabling the model to retain prior knowledge while\nadapting to new classes. Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR).While ER and PLG contribute to preserving prior\nknowledge, we observe that the model’s predictions are biased towards frequent classes,\nresulting in the forgetting of rare categories. This issue is further amplified by the top-K\npseudo-labels selected by PLG, which predominantly represent dominant classes in the data. To address this, we propose aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) scheme that compensates\nfor class imbalance using object frequency statistics. At taskt, only the current datasetD t\nand its label distributionp t (c)over classesc∈ Ct are available. Datasets and class distribu-\ntions from earlier tasks{D i,p i(c)}t−1\ni=1 are no longer accessible, which makes it challenging\nto directly account for class imbalance across all previously seen tasks. Therefore, we pro-\npose to leverage the pseudo-label predictions of the frozen modelΦ t−1 as a proxy for the\nclass distribution across previously learned categories. During each training iteration, the previous modelΦ t−1 is applied to the current inputP\nto generate pseudo-labels ˜Yt , from which we accumulate class-wise frequency statistics for\npreviously learned classes. LetC1:t = St\ni=1 Ci represent the union of all classes seen up to task\nt. At the end of each epoch, we compute the overall class frequencyf∈R |C1:t | by combining\nthe pseudo-label distribution ˜pt (c)derived from ˜Yt with the ground-truth label distribution\npt (c)from the current task. The resulting frequency vectorf= [f(c)] c∈C1:t is then used to\ncompute class-wise weightsw= [w(c)] c∈C1:t , which guide balanced pseudo-label selection\nand help the model focus on rare classes. In the next epoch, the modelΦ t−1 produces soft pseudo-label predictions ˜Yt (as de-\nscribed in PLG) , where each component ˜Yt [c]denotes the confidence score for classc∈\nC1:t−1. To promote balanced pseudo-label selection, class-wise re-weighting is applied using\nw(c) = 1\nf(c)+ε , whereεis a small constant for numerical stability. The adjusted predictions\nare computed by applying the class-wise weights as: ˜Yt,w [c] =w(c)· ˜Yt [c],∀c∈ C 1:t−1. Top-Kselection is then applied to both the original and the re-weighted scores, yielding\ntwo pseudo-label sets: ˜Yt\nK and ˜Yt,w\nK , respectively. The final augmented target set, Yt , is\nconstructed by concatenating the ground-truth labelsY t with both sets of pseudo-labels:\nYt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt\nK ∥ ˜Yt,w\nK .(2)\nAlthough the above re-weighting mitigates bias from prior tasks, it does not address class\nimbalance within the current taskt. To resolve this, the class-balanced weightsw c are ex-\ntended to incorporate statistics from both previously seen and current classes, i.e., overC 1:t\nrather than onlyC 1:t−1. The updated weights, denoted asw ′\nc, are used to re-weights both\npseudo-label selection and classification loss, ensuring balanced supervision across all seen\ncategories, including rare ones. This unified strategy reduces bias and enhances performance\nacross phases. The pseudo-code for constructing the supervision set in Eq. (2), which incor-\nporates both PLG and CBR components, is provided in Appendix A. Final Objective.The final training objective ofCLIMB-3D, incorporating ER, PLG, and THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D7\nCBR, is formulated in Eq. (1) as:\nL(Dt\nER;Φt ) = 1\n|Dt\nER| ∑\n(P,Yt )∈Dt\nER\n1\n|Yt | ∑\n(mt\nj,ct\nj)∈Yt\n", "cot_answer": "Step 1: The Oracle Context mentions that \"The ER+KD module does not focus on rare classes like shower and toaster which results in low performance, but the IC module compensates for this imbalance by focusing on underrepresented categories.\" Step 2: This indicates that the classes not focused on by the ER+KD module but compensated for by the IC module are 'shower' and 'toaster'.

These pseudo-labels are then weighted\nbased on class frequencyf(c)using Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR), and the top-Kre-\nweighted labels are selected to form the balanced pseudo-label set ¯Yt . This pseudo-label set\nis then concatenated with the ground-truth labels to form a final augmented supervision set\nYt for taskt, which is used to optimise the modelΦ t using Eq. (3). 3 Methodology\n3.1 Problem Formulation\n3DIS.The objective of this task is to detect and segment each object instance within a point\ncloud. Formally, the training dataset is denoted asD={(P i,Yi)}N\ni=1, whereNis the number\nof training samples. Each inputP i ∈R M×6 is a coloured point cloud consisting ofMpoints,\nwhere each point is represented by its 3D coordinates and RGB values. The corresponding\nannotationY i ={(m i,j ,ci,j )}Ji\nj=1 containsJ i object instances, wheremi,j ∈ {0,1}M is a binary\nmask indicating which points belong to thej-th instance, andc i,j ∈ C={1,...,C}is the\nsemantic class label of that instance. GivenP i, the modelΦpredicts instance-level outputs\nˆYi ={(ˆmi,j ,ˆci,j )}\nˆJi\nj=1, where ˆmi,j and ˆci,j denote the predicted mask and category label for\nthej-th instance, respectively. The number of predicted instances ˆJi varies depending on the\nmodel’s inference. The model is optimised using the following objective:\nL3DIS(D;Φ) = 1\n|D| ∑\n(P,Y)∈D\n1\n|Y| ∑\n(mj,cj)∈Y\n(Lmask(mj,ˆmj)+λ·L cls(cj,ˆcj)),(1)\nwhereL cls andL mask are the average classification and mask losses over all instances, andλ\ncontrols their trade-off. CI-3DIS.Unlike conventional 3DIS, CI-3DIS involves sequential learning, where object\ncategories are introduced incrementally overTtraining tasks. Each tasktintroduces a dis-\njoint set of classesC t , withC= ST\nt=1 Ct andC t ∩C t′\n=/ 0 fort̸=t ′. During each taskt, the THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D5\nmodel receives a datasetD t ={(P i,Yt\ni)}N\ni=1, where each coloured point cloudP i ∈R M×6\ncontainsMpoints, and the corresponding annotationY t\ni ={(m t\ni,j ,ct\ni,j )}\nJt\ni\nj=1 includes instance\nmasksm t\ni,j ∈ {0,1}M and semantic class labelsc t\ni,j ∈ Ct . The modelΦ t , initialized from\nΦt−1 , is trained onD t to predict instance-level outputs ˆYt\ni ={(ˆmt\ni,j ,ˆct\ni,j )}\nˆJt\ni\nj=1, where each\npredicted semantic label ˆct\ni,j belongs to the cumulative set of all classes observed so far:St\nk=1 Ck. The key challenge in this setup is to learn new classes without forgetting those\nencountered in previous tasks, despite limited supervision and the absence of past labels. 3.2 Method: CLIMB-3D\nOverview.As shown in Fig. 2 and formulated in Sec. 3.1, the proposed framework for\nCI-3DIS follows aphase-wisetraining strategy. In each phase, the model is exposed to a\ncarefully curated subset of the dataset, simulating real-world scenarios discussed in Sec. 3.3. Training naïvely on such phased data leads tocatastrophic forgetting[51], where the model\nforgets prior knowledge when learning new tasks. To address this, we first incorporateEx-\nemplar Replay(ER) [5], a strategy inspired by 2D incremental methods [1, 43, 54] and\nrecently extended to 3D settings [4], to mitigate forgetting by storing a small set of repre-\nsentative samples from earlier phases. However, ER alone is insufficient to achieve robust\nperformance. To address this, two additional components are introduced: aPseudo-Label\nGenerator(PLG), which leverages a frozen model to generate supervision signals for previ-\nously seen classes, and aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) module that compensates for\nclass imbalance across phases. Each of these components is described in detail below 1. Exemplar Replay (ER).Inspired by Buzzega et al. [5], ER addresses the issue of catas-\ntrophic forgetting by allowing the model to retain a subset of data from earlier phases. During phaset, the model is trained not only on the current task dataD t , but also on a\nset of exemplarsE 1:t−1, collected from previous phases. These exemplars are accumulated\nincrementally:E 1:t−1 =E 1 ∪···∪E t−1 .Here,E t denotes the exemplar subset stored after\nphaset, and|E t |denotes the exemplar replay size. The combined replay dataset is denoted\nas:D t\nER =D t ∪E 1:t−1.Epoch training consists of two stages: first, the model is trained on\nthe current data,D t ; then it is trained using exemplars fromE 1:t−1. While previous CI-3DIS approaches rely on large exemplar sets to mitigate forgetting [4],\nsuch strategies become impractical under memory constraints. Consequently, although ER\naids knowledge retention, it is insufficient on its own for robust performance with a limited\nexemplar budget. Therefore, PLG and CBR are introduced to better preserve past represen-\ntations and enhance generalisation across phases. Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG).In the CI-3DIS setting, during phaset(wheret>1),\nalthough ground-truth labels for previously seen classes are unavailable, the model from the\nprevious phaseΦ t−1 , which preserves knowledge of past tasks, is retained. We use this\nmodel to generate pseudo-labels for previously seen classes, thereby providing approximate\nsupervision during training. This allows the current modelΦt , to retain prior knowledge and\nreduce forgetting, even without access to ground-truth annotations. Given a point cloud and label pair(P,Y t ), fromD t , the previous modelΦ t−1 , generates\npseudo-labels for the previously seen classes as ˆY1:t−1 =Φ t−1 (P), which we denote as ˜Yt\n1For clarity, modifications introduced by each component (ER, PLG, and CBR) are highlighted in green, blue,\nand red, respectively. 6THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D\nfor brevity. However, we observe that utilising all predictions fromΦt−1 introduces noisy or\nincorrect labels, which degrade overall performance. To mitigate this, we select the top-K\nmost confident instance predictions, denoted as ˜Yt\nK, and concatenate them with the ground-\ntruth labels of the current task to obtain the supervision set: ¯Yt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt\nK. Following this,\nthe loss is computed over both the current task’s ground-truth labels and the top-Kconfi-\ndent pseudo-labels from earlier phases, enabling the model to retain prior knowledge while\nadapting to new classes. Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR).While ER and PLG contribute to preserving prior\nknowledge, we observe that the model’s predictions are biased towards frequent classes,\nresulting in the forgetting of rare categories. This issue is further amplified by the top-K\npseudo-labels selected by PLG, which predominantly represent dominant classes in the data. To address this, we propose aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) scheme that compensates\nfor class imbalance using object frequency statistics. At taskt, only the current datasetD t\nand its label distributionp t (c)over classesc∈ Ct are available. Datasets and class distribu-\ntions from earlier tasks{D i,p i(c)}t−1\ni=1 are no longer accessible, which makes it challenging\nto directly account for class imbalance across all previously seen tasks. Therefore, we pro-\npose to leverage the pseudo-label predictions of the frozen modelΦ t−1 as a proxy for the\nclass distribution across previously learned categories. During each training iteration, the previous modelΦ t−1 is applied to the current inputP\nto generate pseudo-labels ˜Yt , from which we accumulate class-wise frequency statistics for\npreviously learned classes. LetC1:t = St\ni=1 Ci represent the union of all classes seen up to task\nt. At the end of each epoch, we compute the overall class frequencyf∈R |C1:t | by combining\nthe pseudo-label distribution ˜pt (c)derived from ˜Yt with the ground-truth label distribution\npt (c)from the current task. The resulting frequency vectorf= [f(c)] c∈C1:t is then used to\ncompute class-wise weightsw= [w(c)] c∈C1:t , which guide balanced pseudo-label selection\nand help the model focus on rare classes. In the next epoch, the modelΦ t−1 produces soft pseudo-label predictions ˜Yt (as de-\nscribed in PLG) , where each component ˜Yt [c]denotes the confidence score for classc∈\nC1:t−1. To promote balanced pseudo-label selection, class-wise re-weighting is applied using\nw(c) = 1\nf(c)+ε , whereεis a small constant for numerical stability. The adjusted predictions\nare computed by applying the class-wise weights as: ˜Yt,w [c] =w(c)· ˜Yt [c],∀c∈ C 1:t−1. Top-Kselection is then applied to both the original and the re-weighted scores, yielding\ntwo pseudo-label sets: ˜Yt\nK and ˜Yt,w\nK , respectively. The final augmented target set, Yt , is\nconstructed by concatenating the ground-truth labelsY t with both sets of pseudo-labels:\nYt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt\nK ∥ ˜Yt,w\nK .(2)\nAlthough the above re-weighting mitigates bias from prior tasks, it does not address class\nimbalance within the current taskt. To resolve this, the class-balanced weightsw c are ex-\ntended to incorporate statistics from both previously seen and current classes, i.e., overC 1:t\nrather than onlyC 1:t−1. The updated weights, denoted asw ′\nc, are used to re-weights both\npseudo-label selection and classification loss, ensuring balanced supervision across all seen\ncategories, including rare ones. This unified strategy reduces bias and enhances performance\nacross phases. The pseudo-code for constructing the supervision set in Eq. (2), which incor-\nporates both PLG and CBR components, is provided in Appendix A. Final Objective.The final training objective ofCLIMB-3D, incorporating ER, PLG, and THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D7\nCBR, is formulated in Eq. (1) as:\nL(Dt\nER;Φt ) = 1\n|Dt\nER| ∑\n(P,Yt )∈Dt\nER\n1\n|Yt | ∑\n(mt\nj,ct\nj)∈Yt\n", "cot_answer": "Step 1: The concept of class balance is relevant in the paper by Yin Cui, Menglin Jia, Tsung-Yi Lin, Yang Song, and Serge Belongie because they introduce a Class-Balanced Loss based on the effective number of samples.##begin_quote## Class-balanced loss based on effective number of samples.##end_quote## This loss function aims to address class imbalance and mitigate forgetting in class-incremental 3D instance segmentation.

However, this assumption is unrealistic in dynamic, real-world environments where new\nclasses emerge gradually and exhibit natural imbalance. Although some approaches ad-\ndress the emergence of new classes, they often overlook class imbalance, which leads\nto suboptimal performance, particularly on rare categories. To tackle this, we propose\nCLIMB-3D, a unified framework forCLass-incrementalImbalance-aware3DIS. Build-\ning upon established exemplar replay (ER) strategies, we show that ER alone is insuf-\nficient to achieve robust performance under memory constraints. To mitigate this, we\nintroduce a novel pseudo-label generator (PLG) that extends supervision to previously\nlearned categories by leveraging predictions from a frozen model trained on prior tasks. Despite its promise, PLG tends to be biased towards frequent classes. Therefore, we\npropose a class-balanced re-weighting (CBR) scheme that estimates object frequencies\nfrom pseudo-labels and dynamically adjusts training bias, without requiring access to\npast data. We design and evaluate three incremental scenarios for 3DIS on the challeng-\ning ScanNet200 dataset and additionally validate our method for semantic segmentation\non ScanNetV2. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing prior work by\nup to 16.76% mAP for instance segmentation and approximately 30% mIoU for semantic\nsegmentation, demonstrating strong generalisation across both frequent and rare classes.

However, this assumption is unrealistic in dynamic, real-world environments where new\nclasses emerge gradually and exhibit natural imbalance. Although some approaches ad-\ndress the emergence of new classes, they often overlook class imbalance, which leads\nto suboptimal performance, particularly on rare categories. To tackle this, we propose\nCLIMB-3D, a unified framework forCLass-incrementalImbalance-aware3DIS. Build-\ning upon established exemplar replay (ER) strategies, we show that ER alone is insuf-\nficient to achieve robust performance under memory constraints. To mitigate this, we\nintroduce a novel pseudo-label generator (PLG) that extends supervision to previously\nlearned categories by leveraging predictions from a frozen model trained on prior tasks. Despite its promise, PLG tends to be biased towards frequent classes. Therefore, we\npropose a class-balanced re-weighting (CBR) scheme that estimates object frequencies\nfrom pseudo-labels and dynamically adjusts training bias, without requiring access to\npast data. We design and evaluate three incremental scenarios for 3DIS on the challeng-\ning ScanNet200 dataset and additionally validate our method for semantic segmentation\non ScanNetV2. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing prior work by\nup to 16.76% mAP for instance segmentation and approximately 30% mIoU for semantic\nsegmentation, demonstrating strong generalisation across both frequent and rare classes.

After every phase, the model must recognise both newly added\nand previously learned classes. For instance, in Task 2, categories such asPillow,Coffee\nTable, andSofa Chairare introduced, while the model is expected to retain recognition\nof earlier classes likeTable,Chair, andCouch. 3D instance segmentation (3DIS) is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves\nidentifying precise object boundaries and class labels in 3D space, with broad applications in\ngraphics, robotics, and augmented reality [4, 39]. Traditional 3DIS methods, including top-\ndown [28, 70, 78], bottom-up [26, 73], and transformer-based approaches [59], perform well\nunder the assumption that all classes are available and balanced during training. However,\nthis assumption does not hold in real-world environments, where new object classes emerge\nover time and exhibit natural imbalance. This gap motivates the need for Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) [17, 54], which sup-\nports learning new categories while retaining knowledge of previous ones [51]. While CIL\nhas seen success in 2D image tasks [1, 43, 54, 60], extensions to 3D point clouds remain\nlimited, often focusing on object-level classification [13, 18, 48]. Recent works on scene-\nlevel class-incremental 3DIS (CI-3DIS) [4] and class-incremental semantic segmentation\n(CI-3DSS) [74] show promise, but depend heavily on large exemplar [56] and overlook class\nimbalance, limiting their practicality. To address this, we proposeCLIMB-3D, a unified framework forCLass-incremental\nIMBalance-aware3DIS that jointly tackles catastrophic forgetting and class imbalance. The\nframework begins with Exemplar Replay (ER), storing a small number of samples from\npast classes for later replay. However, this alone does not yield promising results under the\nstrict memory constraints required in CI-3DIS. To address this, we introduce a Pseudo-Label\nGenerator (PLG), which uses a frozen model from previous task to generate supervision for\nearlier classes. However, we observed that PLG tends to favour frequent classes while ig-\nnoring under-represented ones. To mitigate this, we propose a Class-Balanced Re-weighting\n(CBR), which estimates class frequencies from the pseudo-labels to enhance the learning of\nrare classes without accessing past data. Together, these components form a practical and\neffective solution for real-world 3DIS. To evaluate CLIMB-3D, we designed three benchmark scenarios for CI-3DIS based on\nthe ScanNet200 dataset [57]. These scenarios simulate incremental learning setup under nat-\nural class imbalance, where new classes emerge based on (A) object frequency, (B) semantic\nsimilarity, or (C) random grouping. Additionally, for comparison with existing methods,\nwe evaluate our approach on CI-3DSS using the ScanNetV2 dataset [16]. Experimental re-\nsults show that our method significantly reduces forgetting and improves performance across\nboth frequent and rare categories, outperforming previous methods in both settings. Fig. 1\nillustrates the CI-3DIS setup. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D3\nIn summary, our contributions are: (i) a novel problem setting of imbalanced class-\nincremental 3DIS with an effective method to balance learning and mitigate forgetting; (ii)\nthree benchmarks modelling continual object emergence with natural imbalance; and (iii)\nstrong experimental results, achieving up to 16.76% mAP improvement over baselines. 2 Related Work\n3D Instance Segmentation.Various methods have been proposed for 3DIS. Grouping-\nbased approaches adopt a bottom-up pipeline that learns latent embeddings for point cluster-\ning [9, 21, 22, 29, 37, 44, 70, 78]. In contrast, proposal-based methods follow a top-down\nstrategy by detecting 3D boxes and segmenting objects within them [19, 26, 46, 73, 76]. Recently, transformer-based models [68] have also been applied to 3DIS and 3DSS [59, 64],\ninspired by advances in 2D vision [10, 11]. However, these approaches require full anno-\ntations for all classes and are not designed for progressive learning, where only new class\nannotations are available and previous data is inaccessible. Another line of work aims to re-\nduce annotation costs by proposing weakly supervised 3DIS methods based on sparse cues\n[12, 27, 72]. While effective with limited annotations, these methods assume a fixed set of\nclasses and are susceptible to catastrophic forgetting in incremental settings. Incremental Learning.Continual learning involves training models sequentially to miti-\ngate catastrophic forgetting. One common strategy is model regularisation, which constrains\nparameter updates using techniques such as elastic weight consolidation or knowledge dis-\ntillation [1, 24, 35, 43, 60]. Another approach is exemplar replay, where past data is stored\nor generated to rehearse older tasks while learning new ones [5, 7, 30, 54]. A third direc-\ntion involves dynamically expanding the model architecture or using modular sub-networks\nto accommodate new tasks without interfering with old ones [31, 42, 53, 58, 71, 79]. Re-\ncent efforts in class-incremental 3D segmentation [63, 74] have shown early promise but\noften rely on basic architectures and focus primarily on semantic segmentation. Other works\n[4, 36] explore continual learning in 3D settings, though they often depend on large memory\nbuffers. In contrast, our work introduces a tailored framework for 3D instance segmentation\nthat effectively transfers knowledge across tasks, even under class imbalance. Long-tailed Recognition.Imbalanced class distributions lead to poor recognition of rare\n(long-tail) classes. To address this, re-sampling methods balance the data via input [8, 20, 50,\n52, 61] or feature space [3, 14, 40], avoiding naïve under-/over-sampling. Loss re-weighting\noffers another direction, using class-based [6, 15, 23, 32, 33, 69] or per-example [45, 55, 62]\nadjustments to ensure fair contribution. Parameter regularisation improves generalisation\nthrough weight constraints [2], albeit requiring careful tuning. Other approaches leverage\ntransfer learning [77, 81], self-supervision [41, 75], or contrastive learning [34, 41, 82] to\nimprove rare-class representations. Long-tailed recognition is well-studied in 2D with large-\nscale datasets [15, 49, 67]; in 3D, ScanNet200 [16, 57] enables similar efforts. Prior 3D\nwork focused on re-weighting, re-sampling, and transfer learning [57], while regularisation\nremains underexplored. CeCo [80] balances class centres via auxiliary loss but overlooks\nsampling and augmentation. Lahoud et al. [38] propose adaptive classifier regularisation\nfor 3D segmentation, outperforming prior approaches without threshold tuning. However,\nneither method considers incremental learning. In contrast, we jointly address long-tail and\ncontinual 3D semantic segmentation. 4THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D\nFeature \nBackbone\nTransformer \nDecoder\nFeature \nBackbone\nTransformer \nDecoder\n(𝑷,𝒀𝑡)\nCurrent model (𝛷\n𝑡\n)\nPseudo Label Generator (PLG) \nSelection\n෨𝑌𝐾\n𝑡\nℒCI−3DIS\n෨𝑌𝐾\n𝑡,𝑤\nത𝑌𝐾\n𝑡\n෠𝑌𝑡\n(𝐷𝑡)\nCurrent Dataset \nExemplar \nReplay (ER)\n+\n~\nClass-Balanced  \nRe-weighting \n(CBR)\n1\n𝑓(𝑐)\nFigure 2: Overview ofCLIMB-3Dfor CI-3DIS.

During taskt, point cloudsPand their corresponding labelsY t are\nsampled from a combination of the current training datasetD t and Exemplar Replay (ER),\nwhich maintains a small memory of past examples. These are then passed to the current\nmodelΦ t to produce predicted labelsY t . The Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG) selects the\ntop-Kpredictions from the previous modelΦ t−1 . These pseudo-labels are then weighted\nbased on class frequencyf(c)using Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR), and the top-Kre-\nweighted labels are selected to form the balanced pseudo-label set ¯Yt . This pseudo-label set\nis then concatenated with the ground-truth labels to form a final augmented supervision set\nYt for taskt, which is used to optimise the modelΦ t using Eq. (3). 3 Methodology\n3.1 Problem Formulation\n3DIS.The objective of this task is to detect and segment each object instance within a point\ncloud. Formally, the training dataset is denoted asD={(P i,Yi)}N\ni=1, whereNis the number\nof training samples. Each inputP i ∈R M×6 is a coloured point cloud consisting ofMpoints,\nwhere each point is represented by its 3D coordinates and RGB values. The corresponding\nannotationY i ={(m i,j ,ci,j )}Ji\nj=1 containsJ i object instances, wheremi,j ∈ {0,1}M is a binary\nmask indicating which points belong to thej-th instance, andc i,j ∈ C={1,...,C}is the\nsemantic class label of that instance. GivenP i, the modelΦpredicts instance-level outputs\nˆYi ={(ˆmi,j ,ˆci,j )}\nˆJi\nj=1, where ˆmi,j and ˆci,j denote the predicted mask and category label for\nthej-th instance, respectively. The number of predicted instances ˆJi varies depending on the\nmodel’s inference. The model is optimised using the following objective:\nL3DIS(D;Φ) = 1\n|D| ∑\n(P,Y)∈D\n1\n|Y| ∑\n(mj,cj)∈Y\n(Lmask(mj,ˆmj)+λ·L cls(cj,ˆcj)),(1)\nwhereL cls andL mask are the average classification and mask losses over all instances, andλ\ncontrols their trade-off. CI-3DIS.Unlike conventional 3DIS, CI-3DIS involves sequential learning, where object\ncategories are introduced incrementally overTtraining tasks. Each tasktintroduces a dis-\njoint set of classesC t , withC= ST\nt=1 Ct andC t ∩C t′\n=/ 0 fort̸=t ′. During each taskt, the THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D5\nmodel receives a datasetD t ={(P i,Yt\ni)}N\ni=1, where each coloured point cloudP i ∈R M×6\ncontainsMpoints, and the corresponding annotationY t\ni ={(m t\ni,j ,ct\ni,j )}\nJt\ni\nj=1 includes instance\nmasksm t\ni,j ∈ {0,1}M and semantic class labelsc t\ni,j ∈ Ct . The modelΦ t , initialized from\nΦt−1 , is trained onD t to predict instance-level outputs ˆYt\ni ={(ˆmt\ni,j ,ˆct\ni,j )}\nˆJt\ni\nj=1, where each\npredicted semantic label ˆct\ni,j belongs to the cumulative set of all classes observed so far:St\nk=1 Ck. The key challenge in this setup is to learn new classes without forgetting those\nencountered in previous tasks, despite limited supervision and the absence of past labels. 3.2 Method: CLIMB-3D\nOverview.As shown in Fig. 2 and formulated in Sec. 3.1, the proposed framework for\nCI-3DIS follows aphase-wisetraining strategy. In each phase, the model is exposed to a\ncarefully curated subset of the dataset, simulating real-world scenarios discussed in Sec. 3.3. Training naïvely on such phased data leads tocatastrophic forgetting[51], where the model\nforgets prior knowledge when learning new tasks. To address this, we first incorporateEx-\nemplar Replay(ER) [5], a strategy inspired by 2D incremental methods [1, 43, 54] and\nrecently extended to 3D settings [4], to mitigate forgetting by storing a small set of repre-\nsentative samples from earlier phases. However, ER alone is insufficient to achieve robust\nperformance. To address this, two additional components are introduced: aPseudo-Label\nGenerator(PLG), which leverages a frozen model to generate supervision signals for previ-\nously seen classes, and aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) module that compensates for\nclass imbalance across phases. Each of these components is described in detail below 1. Exemplar Replay (ER).Inspired by Buzzega et al. [5], ER addresses the issue of catas-\ntrophic forgetting by allowing the model to retain a subset of data from earlier phases. During phaset, the model is trained not only on the current task dataD t , but also on a\nset of exemplarsE 1:t−1, collected from previous phases. These exemplars are accumulated\nincrementally:E 1:t−1 =E 1 ∪···∪E t−1 .Here,E t denotes the exemplar subset stored after\nphaset, and|E t |denotes the exemplar replay size. The combined replay dataset is denoted\nas:D t\nER =D t ∪E 1:t−1.Epoch training consists of two stages: first, the model is trained on\nthe current data,D t ; then it is trained using exemplars fromE 1:t−1. While previous CI-3DIS approaches rely on large exemplar sets to mitigate forgetting [4],\nsuch strategies become impractical under memory constraints. Consequently, although ER\naids knowledge retention, it is insufficient on its own for robust performance with a limited\nexemplar budget. Therefore, PLG and CBR are introduced to better preserve past represen-\ntations and enhance generalisation across phases. Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG).In the CI-3DIS setting, during phaset(wheret>1),\nalthough ground-truth labels for previously seen classes are unavailable, the model from the\nprevious phaseΦ t−1 , which preserves knowledge of past tasks, is retained. We use this\nmodel to generate pseudo-labels for previously seen classes, thereby providing approximate\nsupervision during training. This allows the current modelΦt , to retain prior knowledge and\nreduce forgetting, even without access to ground-truth annotations. Given a point cloud and label pair(P,Y t ), fromD t , the previous modelΦ t−1 , generates\npseudo-labels for the previously seen classes as ˆY1:t−1 =Φ t−1 (P), which we denote as ˜Yt\n1For clarity, modifications introduced by each component (ER, PLG, and CBR) are highlighted in green, blue,\nand red, respectively. 6THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D\nfor brevity. However, we observe that utilising all predictions fromΦt−1 introduces noisy or\nincorrect labels, which degrade overall performance. To mitigate this, we select the top-K\nmost confident instance predictions, denoted as ˜Yt\nK, and concatenate them with the ground-\ntruth labels of the current task to obtain the supervision set: ¯Yt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt\nK. Following this,\nthe loss is computed over both the current task’s ground-truth labels and the top-Kconfi-\ndent pseudo-labels from earlier phases, enabling the model to retain prior knowledge while\nadapting to new classes. Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR).While ER and PLG contribute to preserving prior\nknowledge, we observe that the model’s predictions are biased towards frequent classes,\nresulting in the forgetting of rare categories. This issue is further amplified by the top-K\npseudo-labels selected by PLG, which predominantly represent dominant classes in the data. To address this, we propose aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) scheme that compensates\nfor class imbalance using object frequency statistics. At taskt, only the current datasetD t\nand its label distributionp t (c)over classesc∈ Ct are available. Datasets and class distribu-\ntions from earlier tasks{D i,p i(c)}t−1\ni=1 are no longer accessible, which makes it challenging\nto directly account for class imbalance across all previously seen tasks. Therefore, we pro-\npose to leverage the pseudo-label predictions of the frozen modelΦ t−1 as a proxy for the\nclass distribution across previously learned categories. During each training iteration, the previous modelΦ t−1 is applied to the current inputP\nto generate pseudo-labels ˜Yt , from which we accumulate class-wise frequency statistics for\npreviously learned classes. LetC1:t = St\ni=1 Ci represent the union of all classes seen up to task\nt. At the end of each epoch, we compute the overall class frequencyf∈R |C1:t | by combining\nthe pseudo-label distribution ˜pt (c)derived from ˜Yt with the ground-truth label distribution\npt (c)from the current task. The resulting frequency vectorf= [f(c)] c∈C1:t is then used to\ncompute class-wise weightsw= [w(c)] c∈C1:t , which guide balanced pseudo-label selection\nand help the model focus on rare classes. In the next epoch, the modelΦ t−1 produces soft pseudo-label predictions ˜Yt (as de-\nscribed in PLG) , where each component ˜Yt [c]denotes the confidence score for classc∈\nC1:t−1. To promote balanced pseudo-label selection, class-wise re-weighting is applied using\nw(c) = 1\nf(c)+ε , whereεis a small constant for numerical stability. The adjusted predictions\nare computed by applying the class-wise weights as: ˜Yt,w [c] =w(c)· ˜Yt [c],∀c∈ C 1:t−1. Top-Kselection is then applied to both the original and the re-weighted scores, yielding\ntwo pseudo-label sets: ˜Yt\nK and ˜Yt,w\nK , respectively. The final augmented target set, Yt , is\nconstructed by concatenating the ground-truth labelsY t with both sets of pseudo-labels:\nYt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt\nK ∥ ˜Yt,w\nK .(2)\nAlthough the above re-weighting mitigates bias from prior tasks, it does not address class\nimbalance within the current taskt. To resolve this, the class-balanced weightsw c are ex-\ntended to incorporate statistics from both previously seen and current classes, i.e., overC 1:t\nrather than onlyC 1:t−1. The updated weights, denoted asw ′\nc, are used to re-weights both\npseudo-label selection and classification loss, ensuring balanced supervision across all seen\ncategories, including rare ones. This unified strategy reduces bias and enhances performance\nacross phases. The pseudo-code for constructing the supervision set in Eq. (2), which incor-\nporates both PLG and CBR components, is provided in Appendix A.

Fig. 4 illustrates the results on theSplit-Aevaluation after learning all\ntasks, comparing the performance of the baseline method and our proposed approach. As\nshown in the figure, our method demonstrates superior instance segmentation performance\ncompared to the baseline. For example, in row 1, the baseline method fails to segment\nthesink, while in row 3, thesofainstance is missed.

However, this assumption is unrealistic in dynamic, real-world environments where new\nclasses emerge gradually and exhibit natural imbalance. Although some approaches ad-\ndress the emergence of new classes, they often overlook class imbalance, which leads\nto suboptimal performance, particularly on rare categories. To tackle this, we propose\nCLIMB-3D, a unified framework forCLass-incrementalImbalance-aware3DIS. Build-\ning upon established exemplar replay (ER) strategies, we show that ER alone is insuf-\nficient to achieve robust performance under memory constraints. To mitigate this, we\nintroduce a novel pseudo-label generator (PLG) that extends supervision to previously\nlearned categories by leveraging predictions from a frozen model trained on prior tasks. Despite its promise, PLG tends to be biased towards frequent classes. Therefore, we\npropose a class-balanced re-weighting (CBR) scheme that estimates object frequencies\nfrom pseudo-labels and dynamically adjusts training bias, without requiring access to\npast data. We design and evaluate three incremental scenarios for 3DIS on the challeng-\ning ScanNet200 dataset and additionally validate our method for semantic segmentation\non ScanNetV2. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing prior work by\nup to 16.76% mAP for instance segmentation and approximately 30% mIoU for semantic\nsegmentation, demonstrating strong generalisation across both frequent and rare classes.

The results clearly demonstrate that our model\nconsistently retains knowledge of previous tasks better than the baseline. ForSplit-A, our\nmodel shows improvement throughout the phase. In Phase 3 of (s2), although both the base-\nline and our method exhibit a performance drop, our method reduces forgetting significantly\ncompared to the baseline. TheSplit-Bscenario, while more complex thanSplit-A, achieves\ncomparable results due to semantic similarity among classes within the same task.

Overall, our proposed\nmethod improves mAP by 5.6%. In this supplementary material, we first demonstrate the performance gains on rare classes\nachieved by incorporating the IC module in Appendix C. Next, we provide detailed split in-\nformation for all scenarios, based on class names, in Appendix D. Finally, we present a qual-\nitative comparison between the baseline method and our proposed approach in Appendix\nE. Appendix C Evaluation on Rare Categories\nThe proposed imbalance correction (IC) module, as detailed in Section 4.2, is designed to\naddress the performance gap for rare classes. To assess its impact, we compare its perfor-\nmance with the framework which has exemplar replay (ER) and knowledge distillation (KD). Specifically, we focus on its ability to improve performance for rare classes, which the model\nencounters infrequently compared to more common classes. The results, shown in Tab.\n\n5 and Tab. 6, correspond to evaluations onSplit-AforPhase\n2andPhase 3, respectively. InPhase 2, we evaluate classes seen 1–20 times per epoch,\nwhilePhase 3targets even less frequent classes, with observations limited to 1–10 times per\nepoch. As illustrated in Tab. 5, the IC module substantially improves performance on rare\nclasses in terms of mAP 50 in Phase 2 ofSplit-A. For instance, classes likerecycling\nbinandtrash bin, seen only 3 and 7 times, respectively, shows significant improvement\nwhen the IC module is applied. Overall, the IC module provides an average boost of 8.32%,\nhighlighting its effectiveness in mitigating class imbalance. Similarly, Tab. 6 presents results forPhase 3, demonstrating significant gains for infre-\nquent classes. For example, even though the classes such aspiano,bucket, andlaundry\nbasketare observed only once, IC module improves the performance by 52.30%, 10.40%,\nand 13.60%, respectively. The ER+KD module does not focus on rare classes likeshower\nandtoasterwhich results in low performance, but the IC module compensates for this imbal-\nance by focusing on underrepresented categories. On average, the addition of the proposed THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D3\nTable 5: Results for classes observed by the model 1–20 times during an epoch, evaluated\nonSplit-Afor Phase 2, in terms of mAP 50.

Appendix E Qualitative Results\nIn this section, we present a qualitative comparison of the proposed framework with the\nbaseline method. Fig. 4 illustrates the results on theSplit-Aevaluation after learning all\ntasks, comparing the performance of the baseline method and our proposed approach. As\nshown in the figure, our method demonstrates superior instance segmentation performance\ncompared to the baseline.

However, this assumption is unrealistic in dynamic, real-world environments where new\nclasses emerge gradually and exhibit natural imbalance. Although some approaches ad-\ndress the emergence of new classes, they often overlook class imbalance, which leads\nto suboptimal performance, particularly on rare categories. To tackle this, we propose\nCLIMB-3D, a unified framework forCLass-incrementalImbalance-aware3DIS. Build-\ning upon established exemplar replay (ER) strategies, we show that ER alone is insuf-\nficient to achieve robust performance under memory constraints. To mitigate this, we\nintroduce a novel pseudo-label generator (PLG) that extends supervision to previously\nlearned categories by leveraging predictions from a frozen model trained on prior tasks. Despite its promise, PLG tends to be biased towards frequent classes. Therefore, we\npropose a class-balanced re-weighting (CBR) scheme that estimates object frequencies\nfrom pseudo-labels and dynamically adjusts training bias, without requiring access to\npast data. We design and evaluate three incremental scenarios for 3DIS on the challeng-\ning ScanNet200 dataset and additionally validate our method for semantic segmentation\non ScanNetV2. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing prior work by\nup to 16.76% mAP for instance segmentation and approximately 30% mIoU for semantic\nsegmentation, demonstrating strong generalisation across both frequent and rare classes.

After every phase, the model must recognise both newly added\nand previously learned classes. For instance, in Task 2, categories such asPillow,Coffee\nTable, andSofa Chairare introduced, while the model is expected to retain recognition\nof earlier classes likeTable,Chair, andCouch. 3D instance segmentation (3DIS) is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves\nidentifying precise object boundaries and class labels in 3D space, with broad applications in\ngraphics, robotics, and augmented reality [4, 39]. Traditional 3DIS methods, including top-\ndown [28, 70, 78], bottom-up [26, 73], and transformer-based approaches [59], perform well\nunder the assumption that all classes are available and balanced during training. However,\nthis assumption does not hold in real-world environments, where new object classes emerge\nover time and exhibit natural imbalance. This gap motivates the need for Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) [17, 54], which sup-\nports learning new categories while retaining knowledge of previous ones [51]. While CIL\nhas seen success in 2D image tasks [1, 43, 54, 60], extensions to 3D point clouds remain\nlimited, often focusing on object-level classification [13, 18, 48]. Recent works on scene-\nlevel class-incremental 3DIS (CI-3DIS) [4] and class-incremental semantic segmentation\n(CI-3DSS) [74] show promise, but depend heavily on large exemplar [56] and overlook class\nimbalance, limiting their practicality. To address this, we proposeCLIMB-3D, a unified framework forCLass-incremental\nIMBalance-aware3DIS that jointly tackles catastrophic forgetting and class imbalance. The\nframework begins with Exemplar Replay (ER), storing a small number of samples from\npast classes for later replay. However, this alone does not yield promising results under the\nstrict memory constraints required in CI-3DIS. To address this, we introduce a Pseudo-Label\nGenerator (PLG), which uses a frozen model from previous task to generate supervision for\nearlier classes. However, we observed that PLG tends to favour frequent classes while ig-\nnoring under-represented ones. To mitigate this, we propose a Class-Balanced Re-weighting\n(CBR), which estimates class frequencies from the pseudo-labels to enhance the learning of\nrare classes without accessing past data. Together, these components form a practical and\neffective solution for real-world 3DIS. To evaluate CLIMB-3D, we designed three benchmark scenarios for CI-3DIS based on\nthe ScanNet200 dataset [57]. These scenarios simulate incremental learning setup under nat-\nural class imbalance, where new classes emerge based on (A) object frequency, (B) semantic\nsimilarity, or (C) random grouping. Additionally, for comparison with existing methods,\nwe evaluate our approach on CI-3DSS using the ScanNetV2 dataset [16]. Experimental re-\nsults show that our method significantly reduces forgetting and improves performance across\nboth frequent and rare categories, outperforming previous methods in both settings. Fig. 1\nillustrates the CI-3DIS setup. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D3\nIn summary, our contributions are: (i) a novel problem setting of imbalanced class-\nincremental 3DIS with an effective method to balance learning and mitigate forgetting; (ii)\nthree benchmarks modelling continual object emergence with natural imbalance; and (iii)\nstrong experimental results, achieving up to 16.76% mAP improvement over baselines. 2 Related Work\n3D Instance Segmentation.Various methods have been proposed for 3DIS. Grouping-\nbased approaches adopt a bottom-up pipeline that learns latent embeddings for point cluster-\ning [9, 21, 22, 29, 37, 44, 70, 78]. In contrast, proposal-based methods follow a top-down\nstrategy by detecting 3D boxes and segmenting objects within them [19, 26, 46, 73, 76]. Recently, transformer-based models [68] have also been applied to 3DIS and 3DSS [59, 64],\ninspired by advances in 2D vision [10, 11]. However, these approaches require full anno-\ntations for all classes and are not designed for progressive learning, where only new class\nannotations are available and previous data is inaccessible. Another line of work aims to re-\nduce annotation costs by proposing weakly supervised 3DIS methods based on sparse cues\n[12, 27, 72]. While effective with limited annotations, these methods assume a fixed set of\nclasses and are susceptible to catastrophic forgetting in incremental settings. Incremental Learning.Continual learning involves training models sequentially to miti-\ngate catastrophic forgetting. One common strategy is model regularisation, which constrains\nparameter updates using techniques such as elastic weight consolidation or knowledge dis-\ntillation [1, 24, 35, 43, 60]. Another approach is exemplar replay, where past data is stored\nor generated to rehearse older tasks while learning new ones [5, 7, 30, 54]. A third direc-\ntion involves dynamically expanding the model architecture or using modular sub-networks\nto accommodate new tasks without interfering with old ones [31, 42, 53, 58, 71, 79]. Re-\ncent efforts in class-incremental 3D segmentation [63, 74] have shown early promise but\noften rely on basic architectures and focus primarily on semantic segmentation. Other works\n[4, 36] explore continual learning in 3D settings, though they often depend on large memory\nbuffers. In contrast, our work introduces a tailored framework for 3D instance segmentation\nthat effectively transfers knowledge across tasks, even under class imbalance. Long-tailed Recognition.Imbalanced class distributions lead to poor recognition of rare\n(long-tail) classes. To address this, re-sampling methods balance the data via input [8, 20, 50,\n52, 61] or feature space [3, 14, 40], avoiding naïve under-/over-sampling. Loss re-weighting\noffers another direction, using class-based [6, 15, 23, 32, 33, 69] or per-example [45, 55, 62]\nadjustments to ensure fair contribution. Parameter regularisation improves generalisation\nthrough weight constraints [2], albeit requiring careful tuning. Other approaches leverage\ntransfer learning [77, 81], self-supervision [41, 75], or contrastive learning [34, 41, 82] to\nimprove rare-class representations. Long-tailed recognition is well-studied in 2D with large-\nscale datasets [15, 49, 67]; in 3D, ScanNet200 [16, 57] enables similar efforts. Prior 3D\nwork focused on re-weighting, re-sampling, and transfer learning [57], while regularisation\nremains underexplored. CeCo [80] balances class centres via auxiliary loss but overlooks\nsampling and augmentation. Lahoud et al. [38] propose adaptive classifier regularisation\nfor 3D segmentation, outperforming prior approaches without threshold tuning. However,\nneither method considers incremental learning. In contrast, we jointly address long-tail and\ncontinual 3D semantic segmentation. 4THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D\nFeature \nBackbone\nTransformer \nDecoder\nFeature \nBackbone\nTransformer \nDecoder\n(𝑷,𝒀𝑡)\nCurrent model (𝛷\n𝑡\n)\nPseudo Label Generator (PLG) \nSelection\n෨𝑌𝐾\n𝑡\nℒCI−3DIS\n෨𝑌𝐾\n𝑡,𝑤\nത𝑌𝐾\n𝑡\n෠𝑌𝑡\n(𝐷𝑡)\nCurrent Dataset \nExemplar \nReplay (ER)\n+\n~\nClass-Balanced  \nRe-weighting \n(CBR)\n1\n𝑓(𝑐)\nFigure 2: Overview ofCLIMB-3Dfor CI-3DIS.

During taskt, point cloudsPand their corresponding labelsY t are\nsampled from a combination of the current training datasetD t and Exemplar Replay (ER),\nwhich maintains a small memory of past examples. These are then passed to the current\nmodelΦ t to produce predicted labelsY t . The Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG) selects the\ntop-Kpredictions from the previous modelΦ t−1 . These pseudo-labels are then weighted\nbased on class frequencyf(c)using Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR), and the top-Kre-\nweighted labels are selected to form the balanced pseudo-label set ¯Yt . This pseudo-label set\nis then concatenated with the ground-truth labels to form a final augmented supervision set\nYt for taskt, which is used to optimise the modelΦ t using Eq. (3). 3 Methodology\n3.1 Problem Formulation\n3DIS.The objective of this task is to detect and segment each object instance within a point\ncloud. Formally, the training dataset is denoted asD={(P i,Yi)}N\ni=1, whereNis the number\nof training samples. Each inputP i ∈R M×6 is a coloured point cloud consisting ofMpoints,\nwhere each point is represented by its 3D coordinates and RGB values. The corresponding\nannotationY i ={(m i,j ,ci,j )}Ji\nj=1 containsJ i object instances, wheremi,j ∈ {0,1}M is a binary\nmask indicating which points belong to thej-th instance, andc i,j ∈ C={1,...,C}is the\nsemantic class label of that instance. GivenP i, the modelΦpredicts instance-level outputs\nˆYi ={(ˆmi,j ,ˆci,j )}\nˆJi\nj=1, where ˆmi,j and ˆci,j denote the predicted mask and category label for\nthej-th instance, respectively. The number of predicted instances ˆJi varies depending on the\nmodel’s inference. The model is optimised using the following objective:\nL3DIS(D;Φ) = 1\n|D| ∑\n(P,Y)∈D\n1\n|Y| ∑\n(mj,cj)∈Y\n(Lmask(mj,ˆmj)+λ·L cls(cj,ˆcj)),(1)\nwhereL cls andL mask are the average classification and mask losses over all instances, andλ\ncontrols their trade-off. CI-3DIS.Unlike conventional 3DIS, CI-3DIS involves sequential learning, where object\ncategories are introduced incrementally overTtraining tasks. Each tasktintroduces a dis-\njoint set of classesC t , withC= ST\nt=1 Ct andC t ∩C t′\n=/ 0 fort̸=t ′. During each taskt, the THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D5\nmodel receives a datasetD t ={(P i,Yt\ni)}N\ni=1, where each coloured point cloudP i ∈R M×6\ncontainsMpoints, and the corresponding annotationY t\ni ={(m t\ni,j ,ct\ni,j )}\nJt\ni\nj=1 includes instance\nmasksm t\ni,j ∈ {0,1}M and semantic class labelsc t\ni,j ∈ Ct . The modelΦ t , initialized from\nΦt−1 , is trained onD t to predict instance-level outputs ˆYt\ni ={(ˆmt\ni,j ,ˆct\ni,j )}\nˆJt\ni\nj=1, where each\npredicted semantic label ˆct\ni,j belongs to the cumulative set of all classes observed so far:St\nk=1 Ck. The key challenge in this setup is to learn new classes without forgetting those\nencountered in previous tasks, despite limited supervision and the absence of past labels. 3.2 Method: CLIMB-3D\nOverview.As shown in Fig. 2 and formulated in Sec. 3.1, the proposed framework for\nCI-3DIS follows aphase-wisetraining strategy. In each phase, the model is exposed to a\ncarefully curated subset of the dataset, simulating real-world scenarios discussed in Sec. 3.3. Training naïvely on such phased data leads tocatastrophic forgetting[51], where the model\nforgets prior knowledge when learning new tasks. To address this, we first incorporateEx-\nemplar Replay(ER) [5], a strategy inspired by 2D incremental methods [1, 43, 54] and\nrecently extended to 3D settings [4], to mitigate forgetting by storing a small set of repre-\nsentative samples from earlier phases. However, ER alone is insufficient to achieve robust\nperformance. To address this, two additional components are introduced: aPseudo-Label\nGenerator(PLG), which leverages a frozen model to generate supervision signals for previ-\nously seen classes, and aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) module that compensates for\nclass imbalance across phases. Each of these components is described in detail below 1. Exemplar Replay (ER).Inspired by Buzzega et al. [5], ER addresses the issue of catas-\ntrophic forgetting by allowing the model to retain a subset of data from earlier phases. During phaset, the model is trained not only on the current task dataD t , but also on a\nset of exemplarsE 1:t−1, collected from previous phases. These exemplars are accumulated\nincrementally:E 1:t−1 =E 1 ∪···∪E t−1 .Here,E t denotes the exemplar subset stored after\nphaset, and|E t |denotes the exemplar replay size. The combined replay dataset is denoted\nas:D t\nER =D t ∪E 1:t−1.Epoch training consists of two stages: first, the model is trained on\nthe current data,D t ; then it is trained using exemplars fromE 1:t−1. While previous CI-3DIS approaches rely on large exemplar sets to mitigate forgetting [4],\nsuch strategies become impractical under memory constraints. Consequently, although ER\naids knowledge retention, it is insufficient on its own for robust performance with a limited\nexemplar budget. Therefore, PLG and CBR are introduced to better preserve past represen-\ntations and enhance generalisation across phases. Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG).In the CI-3DIS setting, during phaset(wheret>1),\nalthough ground-truth labels for previously seen classes are unavailable, the model from the\nprevious phaseΦ t−1 , which preserves knowledge of past tasks, is retained. We use this\nmodel to generate pseudo-labels for previously seen classes, thereby providing approximate\nsupervision during training. This allows the current modelΦt , to retain prior knowledge and\nreduce forgetting, even without access to ground-truth annotations. Given a point cloud and label pair(P,Y t ), fromD t , the previous modelΦ t−1 , generates\npseudo-labels for the previously seen classes as ˆY1:t−1 =Φ t−1 (P), which we denote as ˜Yt\n1For clarity, modifications introduced by each component (ER, PLG, and CBR) are highlighted in green, blue,\nand red, respectively. 6THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D\nfor brevity. However, we observe that utilising all predictions fromΦt−1 introduces noisy or\nincorrect labels, which degrade overall performance. To mitigate this, we select the top-K\nmost confident instance predictions, denoted as ˜Yt\nK, and concatenate them with the ground-\ntruth labels of the current task to obtain the supervision set: ¯Yt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt\nK. Following this,\nthe loss is computed over both the current task’s ground-truth labels and the top-Kconfi-\ndent pseudo-labels from earlier phases, enabling the model to retain prior knowledge while\nadapting to new classes. Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR).While ER and PLG contribute to preserving prior\nknowledge, we observe that the model’s predictions are biased towards frequent classes,\nresulting in the forgetting of rare categories. This issue is further amplified by the top-K\npseudo-labels selected by PLG, which predominantly represent dominant classes in the data. To address this, we propose aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) scheme that compensates\nfor class imbalance using object frequency statistics. At taskt, only the current datasetD t\nand its label distributionp t (c)over classesc∈ Ct are available. Datasets and class distribu-\ntions from earlier tasks{D i,p i(c)}t−1\ni=1 are no longer accessible, which makes it challenging\nto directly account for class imbalance across all previously seen tasks. Therefore, we pro-\npose to leverage the pseudo-label predictions of the frozen modelΦ t−1 as a proxy for the\nclass distribution across previously learned categories. During each training iteration, the previous modelΦ t−1 is applied to the current inputP\nto generate pseudo-labels ˜Yt , from which we accumulate class-wise frequency statistics for\npreviously learned classes. LetC1:t = St\ni=1 Ci represent the union of all classes seen up to task\nt. At the end of each epoch, we compute the overall class frequencyf∈R |C1:t | by combining\nthe pseudo-label distribution ˜pt (c)derived from ˜Yt with the ground-truth label distribution\npt (c)from the current task. The resulting frequency vectorf= [f(c)] c∈C1:t is then used to\ncompute class-wise weightsw= [w(c)] c∈C1:t , which guide balanced pseudo-label selection\nand help the model focus on rare classes. In the next epoch, the modelΦ t−1 produces soft pseudo-label predictions ˜Yt (as de-\nscribed in PLG) , where each component ˜Yt [c]denotes the confidence score for classc∈\nC1:t−1. To promote balanced pseudo-label selection, class-wise re-weighting is applied using\nw(c) = 1\nf(c)+ε , whereεis a small constant for numerical stability. The adjusted predictions\nare computed by applying the class-wise weights as: ˜Yt,w [c] =w(c)· ˜Yt [c],∀c∈ C 1:t−1. Top-Kselection is then applied to both the original and the re-weighted scores, yielding\ntwo pseudo-label sets: ˜Yt\nK and ˜Yt,w\nK , respectively. The final augmented target set, Yt , is\nconstructed by concatenating the ground-truth labelsY t with both sets of pseudo-labels:\nYt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt\nK ∥ ˜Yt,w\nK .(2)\nAlthough the above re-weighting mitigates bias from prior tasks, it does not address class\nimbalance within the current taskt. To resolve this, the class-balanced weightsw c are ex-\ntended to incorporate statistics from both previously seen and current classes, i.e., overC 1:t\nrather than onlyC 1:t−1. The updated weights, denoted asw ′\nc, are used to re-weights both\npseudo-label selection and classification loss, ensuring balanced supervision across all seen\ncategories, including rare ones. This unified strategy reduces bias and enhances performance\nacross phases. The pseudo-code for constructing the supervision set in Eq. (2), which incor-\nporates both PLG and CBR components, is provided in Appendix A.

After every phase, the model must recognise both newly added\nand previously learned classes. For instance, in Task 2, categories such asPillow,Coffee\nTable, andSofa Chairare introduced, while the model is expected to retain recognition\nof earlier classes likeTable,Chair, andCouch. 3D instance segmentation (3DIS) is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves\nidentifying precise object boundaries and class labels in 3D space, with broad applications in\ngraphics, robotics, and augmented reality [4, 39]. Traditional 3DIS methods, including top-\ndown [28, 70, 78], bottom-up [26, 73], and transformer-based approaches [59], perform well\nunder the assumption that all classes are available and balanced during training. However,\nthis assumption does not hold in real-world environments, where new object classes emerge\nover time and exhibit natural imbalance. This gap motivates the need for Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) [17, 54], which sup-\nports learning new categories while retaining knowledge of previous ones [51]. While CIL\nhas seen success in 2D image tasks [1, 43, 54, 60], extensions to 3D point clouds remain\nlimited, often focusing on object-level classification [13, 18, 48]. Recent works on scene-\nlevel class-incremental 3DIS (CI-3DIS) [4] and class-incremental semantic segmentation\n(CI-3DSS) [74] show promise, but depend heavily on large exemplar [56] and overlook class\nimbalance, limiting their practicality. To address this, we proposeCLIMB-3D, a unified framework forCLass-incremental\nIMBalance-aware3DIS that jointly tackles catastrophic forgetting and class imbalance. The\nframework begins with Exemplar Replay (ER), storing a small number of samples from\npast classes for later replay. However, this alone does not yield promising results under the\nstrict memory constraints required in CI-3DIS. To address this, we introduce a Pseudo-Label\nGenerator (PLG), which uses a frozen model from previous task to generate supervision for\nearlier classes. However, we observed that PLG tends to favour frequent classes while ig-\nnoring under-represented ones. To mitigate this, we propose a Class-Balanced Re-weighting\n(CBR), which estimates class frequencies from the pseudo-labels to enhance the learning of\nrare classes without accessing past data. Together, these components form a practical and\neffective solution for real-world 3DIS. To evaluate CLIMB-3D, we designed three benchmark scenarios for CI-3DIS based on\nthe ScanNet200 dataset [57]. These scenarios simulate incremental learning setup under nat-\nural class imbalance, where new classes emerge based on (A) object frequency, (B) semantic\nsimilarity, or (C) random grouping. Additionally, for comparison with existing methods,\nwe evaluate our approach on CI-3DSS using the ScanNetV2 dataset [16]. Experimental re-\nsults show that our method significantly reduces forgetting and improves performance across\nboth frequent and rare categories, outperforming previous methods in both settings. Fig. 1\nillustrates the CI-3DIS setup. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D3\nIn summary, our contributions are: (i) a novel problem setting of imbalanced class-\nincremental 3DIS with an effective method to balance learning and mitigate forgetting; (ii)\nthree benchmarks modelling continual object emergence with natural imbalance; and (iii)\nstrong experimental results, achieving up to 16.76% mAP improvement over baselines. 2 Related Work\n3D Instance Segmentation.Various methods have been proposed for 3DIS. Grouping-\nbased approaches adopt a bottom-up pipeline that learns latent embeddings for point cluster-\ning [9, 21, 22, 29, 37, 44, 70, 78]. In contrast, proposal-based methods follow a top-down\nstrategy by detecting 3D boxes and segmenting objects within them [19, 26, 46, 73, 76]. Recently, transformer-based models [68] have also been applied to 3DIS and 3DSS [59, 64],\ninspired by advances in 2D vision [10, 11]. However, these approaches require full anno-\ntations for all classes and are not designed for progressive learning, where only new class\nannotations are available and previous data is inaccessible. Another line of work aims to re-\nduce annotation costs by proposing weakly supervised 3DIS methods based on sparse cues\n[12, 27, 72]. While effective with limited annotations, these methods assume a fixed set of\nclasses and are susceptible to catastrophic forgetting in incremental settings. Incremental Learning.Continual learning involves training models sequentially to miti-\ngate catastrophic forgetting. One common strategy is model regularisation, which constrains\nparameter updates using techniques such as elastic weight consolidation or knowledge dis-\ntillation [1, 24, 35, 43, 60]. Another approach is exemplar replay, where past data is stored\nor generated to rehearse older tasks while learning new ones [5, 7, 30, 54]. A third direc-\ntion involves dynamically expanding the model architecture or using modular sub-networks\nto accommodate new tasks without interfering with old ones [31, 42, 53, 58, 71, 79]. Re-\ncent efforts in class-incremental 3D segmentation [63, 74] have shown early promise but\noften rely on basic architectures and focus primarily on semantic segmentation. Other works\n[4, 36] explore continual learning in 3D settings, though they often depend on large memory\nbuffers. In contrast, our work introduces a tailored framework for 3D instance segmentation\nthat effectively transfers knowledge across tasks, even under class imbalance. Long-tailed Recognition.Imbalanced class distributions lead to poor recognition of rare\n(long-tail) classes. To address this, re-sampling methods balance the data via input [8, 20, 50,\n52, 61] or feature space [3, 14, 40], avoiding naïve under-/over-sampling. Loss re-weighting\noffers another direction, using class-based [6, 15, 23, 32, 33, 69] or per-example [45, 55, 62]\nadjustments to ensure fair contribution. Parameter regularisation improves generalisation\nthrough weight constraints [2], albeit requiring careful tuning. Other approaches leverage\ntransfer learning [77, 81], self-supervision [41, 75], or contrastive learning [34, 41, 82] to\nimprove rare-class representations. Long-tailed recognition is well-studied in 2D with large-\nscale datasets [15, 49, 67]; in 3D, ScanNet200 [16, 57] enables similar efforts. Prior 3D\nwork focused on re-weighting, re-sampling, and transfer learning [57], while regularisation\nremains underexplored. CeCo [80] balances class centres via auxiliary loss but overlooks\nsampling and augmentation. Lahoud et al. [38] propose adaptive classifier regularisation\nfor 3D segmentation, outperforming prior approaches without threshold tuning. However,\nneither method considers incremental learning. In contrast, we jointly address long-tail and\ncontinual 3D semantic segmentation. 4THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D\nFeature \nBackbone\nTransformer \nDecoder\nFeature \nBackbone\nTransformer \nDecoder\n(𝑷,𝒀𝑡)\nCurrent model (𝛷\n𝑡\n)\nPseudo Label Generator (PLG) \nSelection\n෨𝑌𝐾\n𝑡\nℒCI−3DIS\n෨𝑌𝐾\n𝑡,𝑤\nത𝑌𝐾\n𝑡\n෠𝑌𝑡\n(𝐷𝑡)\nCurrent Dataset \nExemplar \nReplay (ER)\n+\n~\nClass-Balanced  \nRe-weighting \n(CBR)\n1\n𝑓(𝑐)\nFigure 2: Overview ofCLIMB-3Dfor CI-3DIS.

During taskt, point cloudsPand their corresponding labelsY t are\nsampled from a combination of the current training datasetD t and Exemplar Replay (ER),\nwhich maintains a small memory of past examples. These are then passed to the current\nmodelΦ t to produce predicted labelsY t . The Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG) selects the\ntop-Kpredictions from the previous modelΦ t−1 . These pseudo-labels are then weighted\nbased on class frequencyf(c)using Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR), and the top-Kre-\nweighted labels are selected to form the balanced pseudo-label set ¯Yt . This pseudo-label set\nis then concatenated with the ground-truth labels to form a final augmented supervision set\nYt for taskt, which is used to optimise the modelΦ t using Eq. (3). 3 Methodology\n3.1 Problem Formulation\n3DIS.The objective of this task is to detect and segment each object instance within a point\ncloud. Formally, the training dataset is denoted asD={(P i,Yi)}N\ni=1, whereNis the number\nof training samples. Each inputP i ∈R M×6 is a coloured point cloud consisting ofMpoints,\nwhere each point is represented by its 3D coordinates and RGB values. The corresponding\nannotationY i ={(m i,j ,ci,j )}Ji\nj=1 containsJ i object instances, wheremi,j ∈ {0,1}M is a binary\nmask indicating which points belong to thej-th instance, andc i,j ∈ C={1,...,C}is the\nsemantic class label of that instance. GivenP i, the modelΦpredicts instance-level outputs\nˆYi ={(ˆmi,j ,ˆci,j )}\nˆJi\nj=1, where ˆmi,j and ˆci,j denote the predicted mask and category label for\nthej-th instance, respectively. The number of predicted instances ˆJi varies depending on the\nmodel’s inference. The model is optimised using the following objective:\nL3DIS(D;Φ) = 1\n|D| ∑\n(P,Y)∈D\n1\n|Y| ∑\n(mj,cj)∈Y\n(Lmask(mj,ˆmj)+λ·L cls(cj,ˆcj)),(1)\nwhereL cls andL mask are the average classification and mask losses over all instances, andλ\ncontrols their trade-off. CI-3DIS.Unlike conventional 3DIS, CI-3DIS involves sequential learning, where object\ncategories are introduced incrementally overTtraining tasks. Each tasktintroduces a dis-\njoint set of classesC t , withC= ST\nt=1 Ct andC t ∩C t′\n=/ 0 fort̸=t ′. During each taskt, the THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D5\nmodel receives a datasetD t ={(P i,Yt\ni)}N\ni=1, where each coloured point cloudP i ∈R M×6\ncontainsMpoints, and the corresponding annotationY t\ni ={(m t\ni,j ,ct\ni,j )}\nJt\ni\nj=1 includes instance\nmasksm t\ni,j ∈ {0,1}M and semantic class labelsc t\ni,j ∈ Ct . The modelΦ t , initialized from\nΦt−1 , is trained onD t to predict instance-level outputs ˆYt\ni ={(ˆmt\ni,j ,ˆct\ni,j )}\nˆJt\ni\nj=1, where each\npredicted semantic label ˆct\ni,j belongs to the cumulative set of all classes observed so far:St\nk=1 Ck. The key challenge in this setup is to learn new classes without forgetting those\nencountered in previous tasks, despite limited supervision and the absence of past labels. 3.2 Method: CLIMB-3D\nOverview.As shown in Fig. 2 and formulated in Sec. 3.1, the proposed framework for\nCI-3DIS follows aphase-wisetraining strategy. In each phase, the model is exposed to a\ncarefully curated subset of the dataset, simulating real-world scenarios discussed in Sec. 3.3. Training naïvely on such phased data leads tocatastrophic forgetting[51], where the model\nforgets prior knowledge when learning new tasks. To address this, we first incorporateEx-\nemplar Replay(ER) [5], a strategy inspired by 2D incremental methods [1, 43, 54] and\nrecently extended to 3D settings [4], to mitigate forgetting by storing a small set of repre-\nsentative samples from earlier phases. However, ER alone is insufficient to achieve robust\nperformance. To address this, two additional components are introduced: aPseudo-Label\nGenerator(PLG), which leverages a frozen model to generate supervision signals for previ-\nously seen classes, and aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) module that compensates for\nclass imbalance across phases. Each of these components is described in detail below 1. Exemplar Replay (ER).Inspired by Buzzega et al. [5], ER addresses the issue of catas-\ntrophic forgetting by allowing the model to retain a subset of data from earlier phases. During phaset, the model is trained not only on the current task dataD t , but also on a\nset of exemplarsE 1:t−1, collected from previous phases. These exemplars are accumulated\nincrementally:E 1:t−1 =E 1 ∪···∪E t−1 .Here,E t denotes the exemplar subset stored after\nphaset, and|E t |denotes the exemplar replay size. The combined replay dataset is denoted\nas:D t\nER =D t ∪E 1:t−1.Epoch training consists of two stages: first, the model is trained on\nthe current data,D t ; then it is trained using exemplars fromE 1:t−1. While previous CI-3DIS approaches rely on large exemplar sets to mitigate forgetting [4],\nsuch strategies become impractical under memory constraints. Consequently, although ER\naids knowledge retention, it is insufficient on its own for robust performance with a limited\nexemplar budget. Therefore, PLG and CBR are introduced to better preserve past represen-\ntations and enhance generalisation across phases. Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG).In the CI-3DIS setting, during phaset(wheret>1),\nalthough ground-truth labels for previously seen classes are unavailable, the model from the\nprevious phaseΦ t−1 , which preserves knowledge of past tasks, is retained. We use this\nmodel to generate pseudo-labels for previously seen classes, thereby providing approximate\nsupervision during training. This allows the current modelΦt , to retain prior knowledge and\nreduce forgetting, even without access to ground-truth annotations. Given a point cloud and label pair(P,Y t ), fromD t , the previous modelΦ t−1 , generates\npseudo-labels for the previously seen classes as ˆY1:t−1 =Φ t−1 (P), which we denote as ˜Yt\n1For clarity, modifications introduced by each component (ER, PLG, and CBR) are highlighted in green, blue,\nand red, respectively. 6THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D\nfor brevity. However, we observe that utilising all predictions fromΦt−1 introduces noisy or\nincorrect labels, which degrade overall performance. To mitigate this, we select the top-K\nmost confident instance predictions, denoted as ˜Yt\nK, and concatenate them with the ground-\ntruth labels of the current task to obtain the supervision set: ¯Yt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt\nK. Following this,\nthe loss is computed over both the current task’s ground-truth labels and the top-Kconfi-\ndent pseudo-labels from earlier phases, enabling the model to retain prior knowledge while\nadapting to new classes. Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR).While ER and PLG contribute to preserving prior\nknowledge, we observe that the model’s predictions are biased towards frequent classes,\nresulting in the forgetting of rare categories. This issue is further amplified by the top-K\npseudo-labels selected by PLG, which predominantly represent dominant classes in the data. To address this, we propose aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) scheme that compensates\nfor class imbalance using object frequency statistics. At taskt, only the current datasetD t\nand its label distributionp t (c)over classesc∈ Ct are available. Datasets and class distribu-\ntions from earlier tasks{D i,p i(c)}t−1\ni=1 are no longer accessible, which makes it challenging\nto directly account for class imbalance across all previously seen tasks. Therefore, we pro-\npose to leverage the pseudo-label predictions of the frozen modelΦ t−1 as a proxy for the\nclass distribution across previously learned categories. During each training iteration, the previous modelΦ t−1 is applied to the current inputP\nto generate pseudo-labels ˜Yt , from which we accumulate class-wise frequency statistics for\npreviously learned classes. LetC1:t = St\ni=1 Ci represent the union of all classes seen up to task\nt. At the end of each epoch, we compute the overall class frequencyf∈R |C1:t | by combining\nthe pseudo-label distribution ˜pt (c)derived from ˜Yt with the ground-truth label distribution\npt (c)from the current task. The resulting frequency vectorf= [f(c)] c∈C1:t is then used to\ncompute class-wise weightsw= [w(c)] c∈C1:t , which guide balanced pseudo-label selection\nand help the model focus on rare classes. In the next epoch, the modelΦ t−1 produces soft pseudo-label predictions ˜Yt (as de-\nscribed in PLG) , where each component ˜Yt [c]denotes the confidence score for classc∈\nC1:t−1. To promote balanced pseudo-label selection, class-wise re-weighting is applied using\nw(c) = 1\nf(c)+ε , whereεis a small constant for numerical stability. The adjusted predictions\nare computed by applying the class-wise weights as: ˜Yt,w [c] =w(c)· ˜Yt [c],∀c∈ C 1:t−1. Top-Kselection is then applied to both the original and the re-weighted scores, yielding\ntwo pseudo-label sets: ˜Yt\nK and ˜Yt,w\nK , respectively. The final augmented target set, Yt , is\nconstructed by concatenating the ground-truth labelsY t with both sets of pseudo-labels:\nYt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt\nK ∥ ˜Yt,w\nK .(2)\nAlthough the above re-weighting mitigates bias from prior tasks, it does not address class\nimbalance within the current taskt. To resolve this, the class-balanced weightsw c are ex-\ntended to incorporate statistics from both previously seen and current classes, i.e., overC 1:t\nrather than onlyC 1:t−1. The updated weights, denoted asw ′\nc, are used to re-weights both\npseudo-label selection and classification loss, ensuring balanced supervision across all seen\ncategories, including rare ones. This unified strategy reduces bias and enhances performance\nacross phases. The pseudo-code for constructing the supervision set in Eq. (2), which incor-\nporates both PLG and CBR components, is provided in Appendix A.

The results clearly demonstrate that our model\nconsistently retains knowledge of previous tasks better than the baseline. ForSplit-A, our\nmodel shows improvement throughout the phase. In Phase 3 of (s2), although both the base-\nline and our method exhibit a performance drop, our method reduces forgetting significantly\ncompared to the baseline.

Overall, our proposed\nmethod improves mAP by 5.6%. In this supplementary material, we first demonstrate the performance gains on rare classes\nachieved by incorporating the IC module in Appendix C. Next, we provide detailed split in-\nformation for all scenarios, based on class names, in Appendix D. Finally, we present a qual-\nitative comparison between the baseline method and our proposed approach in Appendix\nE. Appendix C Evaluation on Rare Categories\nThe proposed imbalance correction (IC) module, as detailed in Section 4.2, is designed to\naddress the performance gap for rare classes. To assess its impact, we compare its perfor-\nmance with the framework which has exemplar replay (ER) and knowledge distillation (KD). Specifically, we focus on its ability to improve performance for rare classes, which the model\nencounters infrequently compared to more common classes. The results, shown in Tab.\n\n5 and Tab. 6, correspond to evaluations onSplit-AforPhase\n2andPhase 3, respectively. InPhase 2, we evaluate classes seen 1–20 times per epoch,\nwhilePhase 3targets even less frequent classes, with observations limited to 1–10 times per\nepoch. As illustrated in Tab. 5, the IC module substantially improves performance on rare\nclasses in terms of mAP 50 in Phase 2 ofSplit-A. For instance, classes likerecycling\nbinandtrash bin, seen only 3 and 7 times, respectively, shows significant improvement\nwhen the IC module is applied. Overall, the IC module provides an average boost of 8.32%,\nhighlighting its effectiveness in mitigating class imbalance. Similarly, Tab. 6 presents results forPhase 3, demonstrating significant gains for infre-\nquent classes. For example, even though the classes such aspiano,bucket, andlaundry\nbasketare observed only once, IC module improves the performance by 52.30%, 10.40%,\nand 13.60%, respectively. The ER+KD module does not focus on rare classes likeshower\nandtoasterwhich results in low performance, but the IC module compensates for this imbal-\nance by focusing on underrepresented categories.

Fig. 4 illustrates the results on theSplit-Aevaluation after learning all\ntasks, comparing the performance of the baseline method and our proposed approach.

After every phase, the model must recognise both newly added\nand previously learned classes. For instance, in Task 2, categories such asPillow,Coffee\nTable, andSofa Chairare introduced, while the model is expected to retain recognition\nof earlier classes likeTable,Chair, andCouch. 3D instance segmentation (3DIS) is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves\nidentifying precise object boundaries and class labels in 3D space, with broad applications in\ngraphics, robotics, and augmented reality [4, 39]. Traditional 3DIS methods, including top-\ndown [28, 70, 78], bottom-up [26, 73], and transformer-based approaches [59], perform well\nunder the assumption that all classes are available and balanced during training. However,\nthis assumption does not hold in real-world environments, where new object classes emerge\nover time and exhibit natural imbalance. This gap motivates the need for Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) [17, 54], which sup-\nports learning new categories while retaining knowledge of previous ones [51]. While CIL\nhas seen success in 2D image tasks [1, 43, 54, 60], extensions to 3D point clouds remain\nlimited, often focusing on object-level classification [13, 18, 48]. Recent works on scene-\nlevel class-incremental 3DIS (CI-3DIS) [4] and class-incremental semantic segmentation\n(CI-3DSS) [74] show promise, but depend heavily on large exemplar [56] and overlook class\nimbalance, limiting their practicality. To address this, we proposeCLIMB-3D, a unified framework forCLass-incremental\nIMBalance-aware3DIS that jointly tackles catastrophic forgetting and class imbalance. The\nframework begins with Exemplar Replay (ER), storing a small number of samples from\npast classes for later replay. However, this alone does not yield promising results under the\nstrict memory constraints required in CI-3DIS. To address this, we introduce a Pseudo-Label\nGenerator (PLG), which uses a frozen model from previous task to generate supervision for\nearlier classes. However, we observed that PLG tends to favour frequent classes while ig-\nnoring under-represented ones. To mitigate this, we propose a Class-Balanced Re-weighting\n(CBR), which estimates class frequencies from the pseudo-labels to enhance the learning of\nrare classes without accessing past data. Together, these components form a practical and\neffective solution for real-world 3DIS. To evaluate CLIMB-3D, we designed three benchmark scenarios for CI-3DIS based on\nthe ScanNet200 dataset [57]. These scenarios simulate incremental learning setup under nat-\nural class imbalance, where new classes emerge based on (A) object frequency, (B) semantic\nsimilarity, or (C) random grouping. Additionally, for comparison with existing methods,\nwe evaluate our approach on CI-3DSS using the ScanNetV2 dataset [16]. Experimental re-\nsults show that our method significantly reduces forgetting and improves performance across\nboth frequent and rare categories, outperforming previous methods in both settings. Fig. 1\nillustrates the CI-3DIS setup. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D3\nIn summary, our contributions are: (i) a novel problem setting of imbalanced class-\nincremental 3DIS with an effective method to balance learning and mitigate forgetting; (ii)\nthree benchmarks modelling continual object emergence with natural imbalance; and (iii)\nstrong experimental results, achieving up to 16.76% mAP improvement over baselines. 2 Related Work\n3D Instance Segmentation.Various methods have been proposed for 3DIS. Grouping-\nbased approaches adopt a bottom-up pipeline that learns latent embeddings for point cluster-\ning [9, 21, 22, 29, 37, 44, 70, 78]. In contrast, proposal-based methods follow a top-down\nstrategy by detecting 3D boxes and segmenting objects within them [19, 26, 46, 73, 76]. Recently, transformer-based models [68] have also been applied to 3DIS and 3DSS [59, 64],\ninspired by advances in 2D vision [10, 11]. However, these approaches require full anno-\ntations for all classes and are not designed for progressive learning, where only new class\nannotations are available and previous data is inaccessible. Another line of work aims to re-\nduce annotation costs by proposing weakly supervised 3DIS methods based on sparse cues\n[12, 27, 72]. While effective with limited annotations, these methods assume a fixed set of\nclasses and are susceptible to catastrophic forgetting in incremental settings. Incremental Learning.Continual learning involves training models sequentially to miti-\ngate catastrophic forgetting. One common strategy is model regularisation, which constrains\nparameter updates using techniques such as elastic weight consolidation or knowledge dis-\ntillation [1, 24, 35, 43, 60]. Another approach is exemplar replay, where past data is stored\nor generated to rehearse older tasks while learning new ones [5, 7, 30, 54]. A third direc-\ntion involves dynamically expanding the model architecture or using modular sub-networks\nto accommodate new tasks without interfering with old ones [31, 42, 53, 58, 71, 79]. Re-\ncent efforts in class-incremental 3D segmentation [63, 74] have shown early promise but\noften rely on basic architectures and focus primarily on semantic segmentation. Other works\n[4, 36] explore continual learning in 3D settings, though they often depend on large memory\nbuffers. In contrast, our work introduces a tailored framework for 3D instance segmentation\nthat effectively transfers knowledge across tasks, even under class imbalance. Long-tailed Recognition.Imbalanced class distributions lead to poor recognition of rare\n(long-tail) classes. To address this, re-sampling methods balance the data via input [8, 20, 50,\n52, 61] or feature space [3, 14, 40], avoiding naïve under-/over-sampling. Loss re-weighting\noffers another direction, using class-based [6, 15, 23, 32, 33, 69] or per-example [45, 55, 62]\nadjustments to ensure fair contribution. Parameter regularisation improves generalisation\nthrough weight constraints [2], albeit requiring careful tuning. Other approaches leverage\ntransfer learning [77, 81], self-supervision [41, 75], or contrastive learning [34, 41, 82] to\nimprove rare-class representations. Long-tailed recognition is well-studied in 2D with large-\nscale datasets [15, 49, 67]; in 3D, ScanNet200 [16, 57] enables similar efforts. Prior 3D\nwork focused on re-weighting, re-sampling, and transfer learning [57], while regularisation\nremains underexplored. CeCo [80] balances class centres via auxiliary loss but overlooks\nsampling and augmentation. Lahoud et al. [38] propose adaptive classifier regularisation\nfor 3D segmentation, outperforming prior approaches without threshold tuning. However,\nneither method considers incremental learning. In contrast, we jointly address long-tail and\ncontinual 3D semantic segmentation. 4THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D\nFeature \nBackbone\nTransformer \nDecoder\nFeature \nBackbone\nTransformer \nDecoder\n(𝑷,𝒀𝑡)\nCurrent model (𝛷\n𝑡\n)\nPseudo Label Generator (PLG) \nSelection\n෨𝑌𝐾\n𝑡\nℒCI−3DIS\n෨𝑌𝐾\n𝑡,𝑤\nത𝑌𝐾\n𝑡\n෠𝑌𝑡\n(𝐷𝑡)\nCurrent Dataset \nExemplar \nReplay (ER)\n+\n~\nClass-Balanced  \nRe-weighting \n(CBR)\n1\n𝑓(𝑐)\nFigure 2: Overview ofCLIMB-3Dfor CI-3DIS.

During taskt, point cloudsPand their corresponding labelsY t are\nsampled from a combination of the current training datasetD t and Exemplar Replay (ER),\nwhich maintains a small memory of past examples. These are then passed to the current\nmodelΦ t to produce predicted labelsY t . The Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG) selects the\ntop-Kpredictions from the previous modelΦ t−1 . These pseudo-labels are then weighted\nbased on class frequencyf(c)using Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR), and the top-Kre-\nweighted labels are selected to form the balanced pseudo-label set ¯Yt . This pseudo-label set\nis then concatenated with the ground-truth labels to form a final augmented supervision set\nYt for taskt, which is used to optimise the modelΦ t using Eq. (3). 3 Methodology\n3.1 Problem Formulation\n3DIS.The objective of this task is to detect and segment each object instance within a point\ncloud. Formally, the training dataset is denoted asD={(P i,Yi)}N\ni=1, whereNis the number\nof training samples. Each inputP i ∈R M×6 is a coloured point cloud consisting ofMpoints,\nwhere each point is represented by its 3D coordinates and RGB values. The corresponding\nannotationY i ={(m i,j ,ci,j )}Ji\nj=1 containsJ i object instances, wheremi,j ∈ {0,1}M is a binary\nmask indicating which points belong to thej-th instance, andc i,j ∈ C={1,...,C}is the\nsemantic class label of that instance. GivenP i, the modelΦpredicts instance-level outputs\nˆYi ={(ˆmi,j ,ˆci,j )}\nˆJi\nj=1, where ˆmi,j and ˆci,j denote the predicted mask and category label for\nthej-th instance, respectively. The number of predicted instances ˆJi varies depending on the\nmodel’s inference. The model is optimised using the following objective:\nL3DIS(D;Φ) = 1\n|D| ∑\n(P,Y)∈D\n1\n|Y| ∑\n(mj,cj)∈Y\n(Lmask(mj,ˆmj)+λ·L cls(cj,ˆcj)),(1)\nwhereL cls andL mask are the average classification and mask losses over all instances, andλ\ncontrols their trade-off. CI-3DIS.Unlike conventional 3DIS, CI-3DIS involves sequential learning, where object\ncategories are introduced incrementally overTtraining tasks. Each tasktintroduces a dis-\njoint set of classesC t , withC= ST\nt=1 Ct andC t ∩C t′\n=/ 0 fort̸=t ′. During each taskt, the THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D5\nmodel receives a datasetD t ={(P i,Yt\ni)}N\ni=1, where each coloured point cloudP i ∈R M×6\ncontainsMpoints, and the corresponding annotationY t\ni ={(m t\ni,j ,ct\ni,j )}\nJt\ni\nj=1 includes instance\nmasksm t\ni,j ∈ {0,1}M and semantic class labelsc t\ni,j ∈ Ct . The modelΦ t , initialized from\nΦt−1 , is trained onD t to predict instance-level outputs ˆYt\ni ={(ˆmt\ni,j ,ˆct\ni,j )}\nˆJt\ni\nj=1, where each\npredicted semantic label ˆct\ni,j belongs to the cumulative set of all classes observed so far:St\nk=1 Ck. The key challenge in this setup is to learn new classes without forgetting those\nencountered in previous tasks, despite limited supervision and the absence of past labels. 3.2 Method: CLIMB-3D\nOverview.As shown in Fig. 2 and formulated in Sec. 3.1, the proposed framework for\nCI-3DIS follows aphase-wisetraining strategy. In each phase, the model is exposed to a\ncarefully curated subset of the dataset, simulating real-world scenarios discussed in Sec. 3.3. Training naïvely on such phased data leads tocatastrophic forgetting[51], where the model\nforgets prior knowledge when learning new tasks. To address this, we first incorporateEx-\nemplar Replay(ER) [5], a strategy inspired by 2D incremental methods [1, 43, 54] and\nrecently extended to 3D settings [4], to mitigate forgetting by storing a small set of repre-\nsentative samples from earlier phases. However, ER alone is insufficient to achieve robust\nperformance. To address this, two additional components are introduced: aPseudo-Label\nGenerator(PLG), which leverages a frozen model to generate supervision signals for previ-\nously seen classes, and aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) module that compensates for\nclass imbalance across phases. Each of these components is described in detail below 1. Exemplar Replay (ER).Inspired by Buzzega et al. [5], ER addresses the issue of catas-\ntrophic forgetting by allowing the model to retain a subset of data from earlier phases. During phaset, the model is trained not only on the current task dataD t , but also on a\nset of exemplarsE 1:t−1, collected from previous phases. These exemplars are accumulated\nincrementally:E 1:t−1 =E 1 ∪···∪E t−1 .Here,E t denotes the exemplar subset stored after\nphaset, and|E t |denotes the exemplar replay size. The combined replay dataset is denoted\nas:D t\nER =D t ∪E 1:t−1.Epoch training consists of two stages: first, the model is trained on\nthe current data,D t ; then it is trained using exemplars fromE 1:t−1. While previous CI-3DIS approaches rely on large exemplar sets to mitigate forgetting [4],\nsuch strategies become impractical under memory constraints. Consequently, although ER\naids knowledge retention, it is insufficient on its own for robust performance with a limited\nexemplar budget. Therefore, PLG and CBR are introduced to better preserve past represen-\ntations and enhance generalisation across phases. Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG).In the CI-3DIS setting, during phaset(wheret>1),\nalthough ground-truth labels for previously seen classes are unavailable, the model from the\nprevious phaseΦ t−1 , which preserves knowledge of past tasks, is retained. We use this\nmodel to generate pseudo-labels for previously seen classes, thereby providing approximate\nsupervision during training. This allows the current modelΦt , to retain prior knowledge and\nreduce forgetting, even without access to ground-truth annotations. Given a point cloud and label pair(P,Y t ), fromD t , the previous modelΦ t−1 , generates\npseudo-labels for the previously seen classes as ˆY1:t−1 =Φ t−1 (P), which we denote as ˜Yt\n1For clarity, modifications introduced by each component (ER, PLG, and CBR) are highlighted in green, blue,\nand red, respectively. 6THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D\nfor brevity. However, we observe that utilising all predictions fromΦt−1 introduces noisy or\nincorrect labels, which degrade overall performance. To mitigate this, we select the top-K\nmost confident instance predictions, denoted as ˜Yt\nK, and concatenate them with the ground-\ntruth labels of the current task to obtain the supervision set: ¯Yt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt\nK. Following this,\nthe loss is computed over both the current task’s ground-truth labels and the top-Kconfi-\ndent pseudo-labels from earlier phases, enabling the model to retain prior knowledge while\nadapting to new classes. Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR).While ER and PLG contribute to preserving prior\nknowledge, we observe that the model’s predictions are biased towards frequent classes,\nresulting in the forgetting of rare categories. This issue is further amplified by the top-K\npseudo-labels selected by PLG, which predominantly represent dominant classes in the data. To address this, we propose aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) scheme that compensates\nfor class imbalance using object frequency statistics. At taskt, only the current datasetD t\nand its label distributionp t (c)over classesc∈ Ct are available. Datasets and class distribu-\ntions from earlier tasks{D i,p i(c)}t−1\ni=1 are no longer accessible, which makes it challenging\nto directly account for class imbalance across all previously seen tasks. Therefore, we pro-\npose to leverage the pseudo-label predictions of the frozen modelΦ t−1 as a proxy for the\nclass distribution across previously learned categories. During each training iteration, the previous modelΦ t−1 is applied to the current inputP\nto generate pseudo-labels ˜Yt , from which we accumulate class-wise frequency statistics for\npreviously learned classes. LetC1:t = St\ni=1 Ci represent the union of all classes seen up to task\nt. At the end of each epoch, we compute the overall class frequencyf∈R |C1:t | by combining\nthe pseudo-label distribution ˜pt (c)derived from ˜Yt with the ground-truth label distribution\npt (c)from the current task. The resulting frequency vectorf= [f(c)] c∈C1:t is then used to\ncompute class-wise weightsw= [w(c)] c∈C1:t , which guide balanced pseudo-label selection\nand help the model focus on rare classes. In the next epoch, the modelΦ t−1 produces soft pseudo-label predictions ˜Yt (as de-\nscribed in PLG) , where each component ˜Yt [c]denotes the confidence score for classc∈\nC1:t−1. To promote balanced pseudo-label selection, class-wise re-weighting is applied using\nw(c) = 1\nf(c)+ε , whereεis a small constant for numerical stability. The adjusted predictions\nare computed by applying the class-wise weights as: ˜Yt,w [c] =w(c)· ˜Yt [c],∀c∈ C 1:t−1. Top-Kselection is then applied to both the original and the re-weighted scores, yielding\ntwo pseudo-label sets: ˜Yt\nK and ˜Yt,w\nK , respectively. The final augmented target set, Yt , is\nconstructed by concatenating the ground-truth labelsY t with both sets of pseudo-labels:\nYt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt\nK ∥ ˜Yt,w\nK .(2)\nAlthough the above re-weighting mitigates bias from prior tasks, it does not address class\nimbalance within the current taskt. To resolve this, the class-balanced weightsw c are ex-\ntended to incorporate statistics from both previously seen and current classes, i.e., overC 1:t\nrather than onlyC 1:t−1.

After every phase, the model must recognise both newly added\nand previously learned classes. For instance, in Task 2, categories such asPillow,Coffee\nTable, andSofa Chairare introduced, while the model is expected to retain recognition\nof earlier classes likeTable,Chair, andCouch. 3D instance segmentation (3DIS) is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves\nidentifying precise object boundaries and class labels in 3D space, with broad applications in\ngraphics, robotics, and augmented reality [4, 39]. Traditional 3DIS methods, including top-\ndown [28, 70, 78], bottom-up [26, 73], and transformer-based approaches [59], perform well\nunder the assumption that all classes are available and balanced during training. However,\nthis assumption does not hold in real-world environments, where new object classes emerge\nover time and exhibit natural imbalance. This gap motivates the need for Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) [17, 54], which sup-\nports learning new categories while retaining knowledge of previous ones [51]. While CIL\nhas seen success in 2D image tasks [1, 43, 54, 60], extensions to 3D point clouds remain\nlimited, often focusing on object-level classification [13, 18, 48]. Recent works on scene-\nlevel class-incremental 3DIS (CI-3DIS) [4] and class-incremental semantic segmentation\n(CI-3DSS) [74] show promise, but depend heavily on large exemplar [56] and overlook class\nimbalance, limiting their practicality. To address this, we proposeCLIMB-3D, a unified framework forCLass-incremental\nIMBalance-aware3DIS that jointly tackles catastrophic forgetting and class imbalance. The\nframework begins with Exemplar Replay (ER), storing a small number of samples from\npast classes for later replay. However, this alone does not yield promising results under the\nstrict memory constraints required in CI-3DIS. To address this, we introduce a Pseudo-Label\nGenerator (PLG), which uses a frozen model from previous task to generate supervision for\nearlier classes. However, we observed that PLG tends to favour frequent classes while ig-\nnoring under-represented ones. To mitigate this, we propose a Class-Balanced Re-weighting\n(CBR), which estimates class frequencies from the pseudo-labels to enhance the learning of\nrare classes without accessing past data. Together, these components form a practical and\neffective solution for real-world 3DIS. To evaluate CLIMB-3D, we designed three benchmark scenarios for CI-3DIS based on\nthe ScanNet200 dataset [57]. These scenarios simulate incremental learning setup under nat-\nural class imbalance, where new classes emerge based on (A) object frequency, (B) semantic\nsimilarity, or (C) random grouping. Additionally, for comparison with existing methods,\nwe evaluate our approach on CI-3DSS using the ScanNetV2 dataset [16]. Experimental re-\nsults show that our method significantly reduces forgetting and improves performance across\nboth frequent and rare categories, outperforming previous methods in both settings. Fig. 1\nillustrates the CI-3DIS setup. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D3\nIn summary, our contributions are: (i) a novel problem setting of imbalanced class-\nincremental 3DIS with an effective method to balance learning and mitigate forgetting; (ii)\nthree benchmarks modelling continual object emergence with natural imbalance; and (iii)\nstrong experimental results, achieving up to 16.76% mAP improvement over baselines. 2 Related Work\n3D Instance Segmentation.Various methods have been proposed for 3DIS. Grouping-\nbased approaches adopt a bottom-up pipeline that learns latent embeddings for point cluster-\ning [9, 21, 22, 29, 37, 44, 70, 78]. In contrast, proposal-based methods follow a top-down\nstrategy by detecting 3D boxes and segmenting objects within them [19, 26, 46, 73, 76]. Recently, transformer-based models [68] have also been applied to 3DIS and 3DSS [59, 64],\ninspired by advances in 2D vision [10, 11]. However, these approaches require full anno-\ntations for all classes and are not designed for progressive learning, where only new class\nannotations are available and previous data is inaccessible. Another line of work aims to re-\nduce annotation costs by proposing weakly supervised 3DIS methods based on sparse cues\n[12, 27, 72]. While effective with limited annotations, these methods assume a fixed set of\nclasses and are susceptible to catastrophic forgetting in incremental settings. Incremental Learning.Continual learning involves training models sequentially to miti-\ngate catastrophic forgetting. One common strategy is model regularisation, which constrains\nparameter updates using techniques such as elastic weight consolidation or knowledge dis-\ntillation [1, 24, 35, 43, 60]. Another approach is exemplar replay, where past data is stored\nor generated to rehearse older tasks while learning new ones [5, 7, 30, 54]. A third direc-\ntion involves dynamically expanding the model architecture or using modular sub-networks\nto accommodate new tasks without interfering with old ones [31, 42, 53, 58, 71, 79]. Re-\ncent efforts in class-incremental 3D segmentation [63, 74] have shown early promise but\noften rely on basic architectures and focus primarily on semantic segmentation. Other works\n[4, 36] explore continual learning in 3D settings, though they often depend on large memory\nbuffers. In contrast, our work introduces a tailored framework for 3D instance segmentation\nthat effectively transfers knowledge across tasks, even under class imbalance. Long-tailed Recognition.Imbalanced class distributions lead to poor recognition of rare\n(long-tail) classes. To address this, re-sampling methods balance the data via input [8, 20, 50,\n52, 61] or feature space [3, 14, 40], avoiding naïve under-/over-sampling. Loss re-weighting\noffers another direction, using class-based [6, 15, 23, 32, 33, 69] or per-example [45, 55, 62]\nadjustments to ensure fair contribution. Parameter regularisation improves generalisation\nthrough weight constraints [2], albeit requiring careful tuning. Other approaches leverage\ntransfer learning [77, 81], self-supervision [41, 75], or contrastive learning [34, 41, 82] to\nimprove rare-class representations. Long-tailed recognition is well-studied in 2D with large-\nscale datasets [15, 49, 67]; in 3D, ScanNet200 [16, 57] enables similar efforts. Prior 3D\nwork focused on re-weighting, re-sampling, and transfer learning [57], while regularisation\nremains underexplored. CeCo [80] balances class centres via auxiliary loss but overlooks\nsampling and augmentation. Lahoud et al. [38] propose adaptive classifier regularisation\nfor 3D segmentation, outperforming prior approaches without threshold tuning. However,\nneither method considers incremental learning. In contrast, we jointly address long-tail and\ncontinual 3D semantic segmentation. 4THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D\nFeature \nBackbone\nTransformer \nDecoder\nFeature \nBackbone\nTransformer \nDecoder\n(𝑷,𝒀𝑡)\nCurrent model (𝛷\n𝑡\n)\nPseudo Label Generator (PLG) \nSelection\n෨𝑌𝐾\n𝑡\nℒCI−3DIS\n෨𝑌𝐾\n𝑡,𝑤\nത𝑌𝐾\n𝑡\n෠𝑌𝑡\n(𝐷𝑡)\nCurrent Dataset \nExemplar \nReplay (ER)\n+\n~\nClass-Balanced  \nRe-weighting \n(CBR)\n1\n𝑓(𝑐)\nFigure 2: Overview ofCLIMB-3Dfor CI-3DIS. The model incrementally learns new classes\nacross sequential phases. During taskt, point cloudsPand their corresponding labelsY t are\nsampled from a combination of the current training datasetD t and Exemplar Replay (ER),\nwhich maintains a small memory of past examples. These are then passed to the current\nmodelΦ t to produce predicted labelsY t . The Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG) selects the\ntop-Kpredictions from the previous modelΦ t−1 . These pseudo-labels are then weighted\nbased on class frequencyf(c)using Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR), and the top-Kre-\nweighted labels are selected to form the balanced pseudo-label set ¯Yt . This pseudo-label set\nis then concatenated with the ground-truth labels to form a final augmented supervision set\nYt for taskt, which is used to optimise the modelΦ t using Eq. (3). 3 Methodology\n3.1 Problem Formulation\n3DIS.The objective of this task is to detect and segment each object instance within a point\ncloud. Formally, the training dataset is denoted asD={(P i,Yi)}N\ni=1, whereNis the number\nof training samples. Each inputP i ∈R M×6 is a coloured point cloud consisting ofMpoints,\nwhere each point is represented by its 3D coordinates and RGB values. The corresponding\nannotationY i ={(m i,j ,ci,j )}Ji\nj=1 containsJ i object instances, wheremi,j ∈ {0,1}M is a binary\nmask indicating which points belong to thej-th instance, andc i,j ∈ C={1,...,C}is the\nsemantic class label of that instance. GivenP i, the modelΦpredicts instance-level outputs\nˆYi ={(ˆmi,j ,ˆci,j )}\nˆJi\nj=1, where ˆmi,j and ˆci,j denote the predicted mask and category label for\nthej-th instance, respectively. The number of predicted instances ˆJi varies depending on the\nmodel’s inference. The model is optimised using the following objective:\nL3DIS(D;Φ) = 1\n|D| ∑\n(P,Y)∈D\n1\n|Y| ∑\n(mj,cj)∈Y\n(Lmask(mj,ˆmj)+λ·L cls(cj,ˆcj)),(1)\nwhereL cls andL mask are the average classification and mask losses over all instances, andλ\ncontrols their trade-off. CI-3DIS.Unlike conventional 3DIS, CI-3DIS involves sequential learning, where object\ncategories are introduced incrementally overTtraining tasks. Each tasktintroduces a dis-\njoint set of classesC t , withC= ST\nt=1 Ct andC t ∩C t′\n=/ 0 fort̸=t ′. During each taskt, the THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D5\nmodel receives a datasetD t ={(P i,Yt\ni)}N\ni=1, where each coloured point cloudP i ∈R M×6\ncontainsMpoints, and the corresponding annotationY t\ni ={(m t\ni,j ,ct\ni,j )}\nJt\ni\nj=1 includes instance\nmasksm t\ni,j ∈ {0,1}M and semantic class labelsc t\ni,j ∈ Ct . The modelΦ t , initialized from\nΦt−1 , is trained onD t to predict instance-level outputs ˆYt\ni ={(ˆmt\ni,j ,ˆct\ni,j )}\nˆJt\ni\nj=1, where each\npredicted semantic label ˆct\ni,j belongs to the cumulative set of all classes observed so far:St\nk=1 Ck. The key challenge in this setup is to learn new classes without forgetting those\nencountered in previous tasks, despite limited supervision and the absence of past labels. 3.2 Method: CLIMB-3D\nOverview.As shown in Fig. 2 and formulated in Sec. 3.1, the proposed framework for\nCI-3DIS follows aphase-wisetraining strategy. In each phase, the model is exposed to a\ncarefully curated subset of the dataset, simulating real-world scenarios discussed in Sec. 3.3. Training naïvely on such phased data leads tocatastrophic forgetting[51], where the model\nforgets prior knowledge when learning new tasks. To address this, we first incorporateEx-\nemplar Replay(ER) [5], a strategy inspired by 2D incremental methods [1, 43, 54] and\nrecently extended to 3D settings [4], to mitigate forgetting by storing a small set of repre-\nsentative samples from earlier phases. However, ER alone is insufficient to achieve robust\nperformance. To address this, two additional components are introduced: aPseudo-Label\nGenerator(PLG), which leverages a frozen model to generate supervision signals for previ-\nously seen classes, and aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) module that compensates for\nclass imbalance across phases. Each of these components is described in detail below 1. Exemplar Replay (ER).Inspired by Buzzega et al. [5], ER addresses the issue of catas-\ntrophic forgetting by allowing the model to retain a subset of data from earlier phases. During phaset, the model is trained not only on the current task dataD t , but also on a\nset of exemplarsE 1:t−1, collected from previous phases. These exemplars are accumulated\nincrementally:E 1:t−1 =E 1 ∪···∪E t−1 .Here,E t denotes the exemplar subset stored after\nphaset, and|E t |denotes the exemplar replay size. The combined replay dataset is denoted\nas:D t\nER =D t ∪E 1:t−1.Epoch training consists of two stages: first, the model is trained on\nthe current data,D t ; then it is trained using exemplars fromE 1:t−1. While previous CI-3DIS approaches rely on large exemplar sets to mitigate forgetting [4],\nsuch strategies become impractical under memory constraints. Consequently, although ER\naids knowledge retention, it is insufficient on its own for robust performance with a limited\nexemplar budget. Therefore, PLG and CBR are introduced to better preserve past represen-\ntations and enhance generalisation across phases. Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG).In the CI-3DIS setting, during phaset(wheret>1),\nalthough ground-truth labels for previously seen classes are unavailable, the model from the\nprevious phaseΦ t−1 , which preserves knowledge of past tasks, is retained. We use this\nmodel to generate pseudo-labels for previously seen classes, thereby providing approximate\nsupervision during training. This allows the current modelΦt , to retain prior knowledge and\nreduce forgetting, even without access to ground-truth annotations. Given a point cloud and label pair(P,Y t ), fromD t , the previous modelΦ t−1 , generates\npseudo-labels for the previously seen classes as ˆY1:t−1 =Φ t−1 (P), which we denote as ˜Yt\n1For clarity, modifications introduced by each component (ER, PLG, and CBR) are highlighted in green, blue,\nand red, respectively. 6THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D\nfor brevity. However, we observe that utilising all predictions fromΦt−1 introduces noisy or\nincorrect labels, which degrade overall performance. To mitigate this, we select the top-K\nmost confident instance predictions, denoted as ˜Yt\nK, and concatenate them with the ground-\ntruth labels of the current task to obtain the supervision set: ¯Yt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt\nK. Following this,\nthe loss is computed over both the current task’s ground-truth labels and the top-Kconfi-\ndent pseudo-labels from earlier phases, enabling the model to retain prior knowledge while\nadapting to new classes. Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR).While ER and PLG contribute to preserving prior\nknowledge, we observe that the model’s predictions are biased towards frequent classes,\nresulting in the forgetting of rare categories. This issue is further amplified by the top-K\npseudo-labels selected by PLG, which predominantly represent dominant classes in the data. To address this, we propose aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) scheme that compensates\nfor class imbalance using object frequency statistics. At taskt, only the current datasetD t\nand its label distributionp t (c)over classesc∈ Ct are available. Datasets and class distribu-\ntions from earlier tasks{D i,p i(c)}t−1\ni=1 are no longer accessible, which makes it challenging\nto directly account for class imbalance across all previously seen tasks. Therefore, we pro-\npose to leverage the pseudo-label predictions of the frozen modelΦ t−1 as a proxy for the\nclass distribution across previously learned categories. During each training iteration, the previous modelΦ t−1 is applied to the current inputP\nto generate pseudo-labels ˜Yt , from which we accumulate class-wise frequency statistics for\npreviously learned classes. LetC1:t = St\ni=1 Ci represent the union of all classes seen up to task\nt. At the end of each epoch, we compute the overall class frequencyf∈R |C1:t | by combining\nthe pseudo-label distribution ˜pt (c)derived from ˜Yt with the ground-truth label distribution\npt (c)from the current task. The resulting frequency vectorf= [f(c)] c∈C1:t is then used to\ncompute class-wise weightsw= [w(c)] c∈C1:t , which guide balanced pseudo-label selection\nand help the model focus on rare classes. In the next epoch, the modelΦ t−1 produces soft pseudo-label predictions ˜Yt (as de-\nscribed in PLG) , where each component ˜Yt [c]denotes the confidence score for classc∈\nC1:t−1. To promote balanced pseudo-label selection, class-wise re-weighting is applied using\nw(c) = 1\nf(c)+ε , whereεis a small constant for numerical stability. The adjusted predictions\nare computed by applying the class-wise weights as: ˜Yt,w [c] =w(c)· ˜Yt [c],∀c∈ C 1:t−1. Top-Kselection is then applied to both the original and the re-weighted scores, yielding\ntwo pseudo-label sets: ˜Yt\nK and ˜Yt,w\nK , respectively. The final augmented target set, Yt , is\nconstructed by concatenating the ground-truth labelsY t with both sets of pseudo-labels:\nYt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt\nK ∥ ˜Yt,w\nK .(2)\nAlthough the above re-weighting mitigates bias from prior tasks, it does not address class\nimbalance within the current taskt. To resolve this, the class-balanced weightsw c are ex-\ntended to incorporate statistics from both previously seen and current classes, i.e., overC 1:t\nrather than onlyC 1:t−1. The updated weights, denoted asw ′\nc, are used to re-weights both\npseudo-label selection and classification loss, ensuring balanced supervision across all seen\ncategories, including rare ones. This unified strategy reduces bias and enhances performance\nacross phases. The pseudo-code for constructing the supervision set in Eq. (2), which incor-\nporates both PLG and CBR components, is provided in Appendix A.

Appendix B Per Phase Analysis\nWe extend the analysis from Tab.\n\n1 to Tab. 4 to highlight the impact of our proposed method\non individual splits across various scenarios. The results clearly demonstrate that our model\nconsistently retains knowledge of previous tasks better than the baseline. ForSplit-A, our\nmodel shows improvement throughout the phase. In Phase 3 of (s2), although both the base-\nline and our method exhibit a performance drop, our method reduces forgetting significantly\ncompared to the baseline. TheSplit-Bscenario, while more complex thanSplit-A, achieves\ncomparable results due to semantic similarity among classes within the same task. In Phase\n2, our model achieves overall all 43.13% mAP50 compared to 24.53% on baseline, a similar\ntrend is observed in Phase 3, where our method not only consistently improves learning but\nalso enhances retention of previous information. After all three tasks, our method achieves\nan overall performance of 31.56% AP50, compared to 15.07% for the baseline. In theSplit-\nCscenario, the first-stage model struggles due to the increased complexity introduced by\nrandom grouping. In Phase 2, while the baseline focuses on learning the current task, it suf-\nfers from severe forgetting of prior knowledge. Conversely, our method balances new task\nlearning with the retention of earlier information. By Phase 3, the model effectively con- 2THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D\nTable 4: Comparison of results in terms of mAP50 with the proposed CLIMB-3D across three\ndifferent scenarios.

Overall, our proposed\nmethod improves mAP by 5.6%. In this supplementary material, we first demonstrate the performance gains on rare classes\nachieved by incorporating the IC module in Appendix C. Next, we provide detailed split in-\nformation for all scenarios, based on class names, in Appendix D. Finally, we present a qual-\nitative comparison between the baseline method and our proposed approach in Appendix\nE. Appendix C Evaluation on Rare Categories\nThe proposed imbalance correction (IC) module, as detailed in Section 4.2, is designed to\naddress the performance gap for rare classes. To assess its impact, we compare its perfor-\nmance with the framework which has exemplar replay (ER) and knowledge distillation (KD). Specifically, we focus on its ability to improve performance for rare classes, which the model\nencounters infrequently compared to more common classes. The results, shown in Tab.\n\n5 and Tab. 6, correspond to evaluations onSplit-AforPhase\n2andPhase 3, respectively. InPhase 2, we evaluate classes seen 1–20 times per epoch,\nwhilePhase 3targets even less frequent classes, with observations limited to 1–10 times per\nepoch. As illustrated in Tab. 5, the IC module substantially improves performance on rare\nclasses in terms of mAP 50 in Phase 2 ofSplit-A. For instance, classes likerecycling\nbinandtrash bin, seen only 3 and 7 times, respectively, shows significant improvement\nwhen the IC module is applied. Overall, the IC module provides an average boost of 8.32%,\nhighlighting its effectiveness in mitigating class imbalance. Similarly, Tab. 6 presents results forPhase 3, demonstrating significant gains for infre-\nquent classes. For example, even though the classes such aspiano,bucket, andlaundry\nbasketare observed only once, IC module improves the performance by 52.30%, 10.40%,\nand 13.60%, respectively. The ER+KD module does not focus on rare classes likeshower\nandtoasterwhich results in low performance, but the IC module compensates for this imbal-\nance by focusing on underrepresented categories.

However, this assumption is unrealistic in dynamic, real-world environments where new\nclasses emerge gradually and exhibit natural imbalance. Although some approaches ad-\ndress the emergence of new classes, they often overlook class imbalance, which leads\nto suboptimal performance, particularly on rare categories. To tackle this, we propose\nCLIMB-3D, a unified framework forCLass-incrementalImbalance-aware3DIS. Build-\ning upon established exemplar replay (ER) strategies, we show that ER alone is insuf-\nficient to achieve robust performance under memory constraints. To mitigate this, we\nintroduce a novel pseudo-label generator (PLG) that extends supervision to previously\nlearned categories by leveraging predictions from a frozen model trained on prior tasks. Despite its promise, PLG tends to be biased towards frequent classes. Therefore, we\npropose a class-balanced re-weighting (CBR) scheme that estimates object frequencies\nfrom pseudo-labels and dynamically adjusts training bias, without requiring access to\npast data. We design and evaluate three incremental scenarios for 3DIS on the challeng-\ning ScanNet200 dataset and additionally validate our method for semantic segmentation\non ScanNetV2. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing prior work by\nup to 16.76% mAP for instance segmentation and approximately 30% mIoU for semantic\nsegmentation, demonstrating strong generalisation across both frequent and rare classes.

However, this assumption is unrealistic in dynamic, real-world environments where new\nclasses emerge gradually and exhibit natural imbalance. Although some approaches ad-\ndress the emergence of new classes, they often overlook class imbalance, which leads\nto suboptimal performance, particularly on rare categories. To tackle this, we propose\nCLIMB-3D, a unified framework forCLass-incrementalImbalance-aware3DIS. Build-\ning upon established exemplar replay (ER) strategies, we show that ER alone is insuf-\nficient to achieve robust performance under memory constraints. To mitigate this, we\nintroduce a novel pseudo-label generator (PLG) that extends supervision to previously\nlearned categories by leveraging predictions from a frozen model trained on prior tasks. Despite its promise, PLG tends to be biased towards frequent classes. Therefore, we\npropose a class-balanced re-weighting (CBR) scheme that estimates object frequencies\nfrom pseudo-labels and dynamically adjusts training bias, without requiring access to\npast data. We design and evaluate three incremental scenarios for 3DIS on the challeng-\ning ScanNet200 dataset and additionally validate our method for semantic segmentation\non ScanNetV2. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing prior work by\nup to 16.76% mAP for instance segmentation and approximately 30% mIoU for semantic\nsegmentation, demonstrating strong generalisation across both frequent and rare classes.

However, this assumption is unrealistic in dynamic, real-world environments where new\nclasses emerge gradually and exhibit natural imbalance. Although some approaches ad-\ndress the emergence of new classes, they often overlook class imbalance, which leads\nto suboptimal performance, particularly on rare categories. To tackle this, we propose\nCLIMB-3D, a unified framework forCLass-incrementalImbalance-aware3DIS. Build-\ning upon established exemplar replay (ER) strategies, we show that ER alone is insuf-\nficient to achieve robust performance under memory constraints. To mitigate this, we\nintroduce a novel pseudo-label generator (PLG) that extends supervision to previously\nlearned categories by leveraging predictions from a frozen model trained on prior tasks. Despite its promise, PLG tends to be biased towards frequent classes. Therefore, we\npropose a class-balanced re-weighting (CBR) scheme that estimates object frequencies\nfrom pseudo-labels and dynamically adjusts training bias, without requiring access to\npast data. We design and evaluate three incremental scenarios for 3DIS on the challeng-\ning ScanNet200 dataset and additionally validate our method for semantic segmentation\non ScanNetV2. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing prior work by\nup to 16.76% mAP for instance segmentation and approximately 30% mIoU for semantic\nsegmentation, demonstrating strong generalisation across both frequent and rare classes.

After every phase, the model must recognise both newly added\nand previously learned classes. For instance, in Task 2, categories such asPillow,Coffee\nTable, andSofa Chairare introduced, while the model is expected to retain recognition\nof earlier classes likeTable,Chair, andCouch. 3D instance segmentation (3DIS) is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves\nidentifying precise object boundaries and class labels in 3D space, with broad applications in\ngraphics, robotics, and augmented reality [4, 39]. Traditional 3DIS methods, including top-\ndown [28, 70, 78], bottom-up [26, 73], and transformer-based approaches [59], perform well\nunder the assumption that all classes are available and balanced during training. However,\nthis assumption does not hold in real-world environments, where new object classes emerge\nover time and exhibit natural imbalance. This gap motivates the need for Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) [17, 54], which sup-\nports learning new categories while retaining knowledge of previous ones [51]. While CIL\nhas seen success in 2D image tasks [1, 43, 54, 60], extensions to 3D point clouds remain\nlimited, often focusing on object-level classification [13, 18, 48]. Recent works on scene-\nlevel class-incremental 3DIS (CI-3DIS) [4] and class-incremental semantic segmentation\n(CI-3DSS) [74] show promise, but depend heavily on large exemplar [56] and overlook class\nimbalance, limiting their practicality. To address this, we proposeCLIMB-3D, a unified framework forCLass-incremental\nIMBalance-aware3DIS that jointly tackles catastrophic forgetting and class imbalance. The\nframework begins with Exemplar Replay (ER), storing a small number of samples from\npast classes for later replay. However, this alone does not yield promising results under the\nstrict memory constraints required in CI-3DIS. To address this, we introduce a Pseudo-Label\nGenerator (PLG), which uses a frozen model from previous task to generate supervision for\nearlier classes. However, we observed that PLG tends to favour frequent classes while ig-\nnoring under-represented ones. To mitigate this, we propose a Class-Balanced Re-weighting\n(CBR), which estimates class frequencies from the pseudo-labels to enhance the learning of\nrare classes without accessing past data. Together, these components form a practical and\neffective solution for real-world 3DIS. To evaluate CLIMB-3D, we designed three benchmark scenarios for CI-3DIS based on\nthe ScanNet200 dataset [57]. These scenarios simulate incremental learning setup under nat-\nural class imbalance, where new classes emerge based on (A) object frequency, (B) semantic\nsimilarity, or (C) random grouping. Additionally, for comparison with existing methods,\nwe evaluate our approach on CI-3DSS using the ScanNetV2 dataset [16]. Experimental re-\nsults show that our method significantly reduces forgetting and improves performance across\nboth frequent and rare categories, outperforming previous methods in both settings. Fig. 1\nillustrates the CI-3DIS setup. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D3\nIn summary, our contributions are: (i) a novel problem setting of imbalanced class-\nincremental 3DIS with an effective method to balance learning and mitigate forgetting; (ii)\nthree benchmarks modelling continual object emergence with natural imbalance; and (iii)\nstrong experimental results, achieving up to 16.76% mAP improvement over baselines. 2 Related Work\n3D Instance Segmentation.Various methods have been proposed for 3DIS. Grouping-\nbased approaches adopt a bottom-up pipeline that learns latent embeddings for point cluster-\ning [9, 21, 22, 29, 37, 44, 70, 78]. In contrast, proposal-based methods follow a top-down\nstrategy by detecting 3D boxes and segmenting objects within them [19, 26, 46, 73, 76]. Recently, transformer-based models [68] have also been applied to 3DIS and 3DSS [59, 64],\ninspired by advances in 2D vision [10, 11]. However, these approaches require full anno-\ntations for all classes and are not designed for progressive learning, where only new class\nannotations are available and previous data is inaccessible. Another line of work aims to re-\nduce annotation costs by proposing weakly supervised 3DIS methods based on sparse cues\n[12, 27, 72]. While effective with limited annotations, these methods assume a fixed set of\nclasses and are susceptible to catastrophic forgetting in incremental settings. Incremental Learning.Continual learning involves training models sequentially to miti-\ngate catastrophic forgetting. One common strategy is model regularisation, which constrains\nparameter updates using techniques such as elastic weight consolidation or knowledge dis-\ntillation [1, 24, 35, 43, 60]. Another approach is exemplar replay, where past data is stored\nor generated to rehearse older tasks while learning new ones [5, 7, 30, 54]. A third direc-\ntion involves dynamically expanding the model architecture or using modular sub-networks\nto accommodate new tasks without interfering with old ones [31, 42, 53, 58, 71, 79]. Re-\ncent efforts in class-incremental 3D segmentation [63, 74] have shown early promise but\noften rely on basic architectures and focus primarily on semantic segmentation. Other works\n[4, 36] explore continual learning in 3D settings, though they often depend on large memory\nbuffers. In contrast, our work introduces a tailored framework for 3D instance segmentation\nthat effectively transfers knowledge across tasks, even under class imbalance. Long-tailed Recognition.Imbalanced class distributions lead to poor recognition of rare\n(long-tail) classes. To address this, re-sampling methods balance the data via input [8, 20, 50,\n52, 61] or feature space [3, 14, 40], avoiding naïve under-/over-sampling. Loss re-weighting\noffers another direction, using class-based [6, 15, 23, 32, 33, 69] or per-example [45, 55, 62]\nadjustments to ensure fair contribution. Parameter regularisation improves generalisation\nthrough weight constraints [2], albeit requiring careful tuning. Other approaches leverage\ntransfer learning [77, 81], self-supervision [41, 75], or contrastive learning [34, 41, 82] to\nimprove rare-class representations. Long-tailed recognition is well-studied in 2D with large-\nscale datasets [15, 49, 67]; in 3D, ScanNet200 [16, 57] enables similar efforts. Prior 3D\nwork focused on re-weighting, re-sampling, and transfer learning [57], while regularisation\nremains underexplored. CeCo [80] balances class centres via auxiliary loss but overlooks\nsampling and augmentation. Lahoud et al. [38] propose adaptive classifier regularisation\nfor 3D segmentation, outperforming prior approaches without threshold tuning. However,\nneither method considers incremental learning. In contrast, we jointly address long-tail and\ncontinual 3D semantic segmentation. 4THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D\nFeature \nBackbone\nTransformer \nDecoder\nFeature \nBackbone\nTransformer \nDecoder\n(𝑷,𝒀𝑡)\nCurrent model (𝛷\n𝑡\n)\nPseudo Label Generator (PLG) \nSelection\n෨𝑌𝐾\n𝑡\nℒCI−3DIS\n෨𝑌𝐾\n𝑡,𝑤\nത𝑌𝐾\n𝑡\n෠𝑌𝑡\n(𝐷𝑡)\nCurrent Dataset \nExemplar \nReplay (ER)\n+\n~\nClass-Balanced  \nRe-weighting \n(CBR)\n1\n𝑓(𝑐)\nFigure 2: Overview ofCLIMB-3Dfor CI-3DIS.

During taskt, point cloudsPand their corresponding labelsY t are\nsampled from a combination of the current training datasetD t and Exemplar Replay (ER),\nwhich maintains a small memory of past examples. These are then passed to the current\nmodelΦ t to produce predicted labelsY t . The Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG) selects the\ntop-Kpredictions from the previous modelΦ t−1 . These pseudo-labels are then weighted\nbased on class frequencyf(c)using Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR), and the top-Kre-\nweighted labels are selected to form the balanced pseudo-label set ¯Yt . This pseudo-label set\nis then concatenated with the ground-truth labels to form a final augmented supervision set\nYt for taskt, which is used to optimise the modelΦ t using Eq. (3). 3 Methodology\n3.1 Problem Formulation\n3DIS.The objective of this task is to detect and segment each object instance within a point\ncloud. Formally, the training dataset is denoted asD={(P i,Yi)}N\ni=1, whereNis the number\nof training samples. Each inputP i ∈R M×6 is a coloured point cloud consisting ofMpoints,\nwhere each point is represented by its 3D coordinates and RGB values. The corresponding\nannotationY i ={(m i,j ,ci,j )}Ji\nj=1 containsJ i object instances, wheremi,j ∈ {0,1}M is a binary\nmask indicating which points belong to thej-th instance, andc i,j ∈ C={1,...,C}is the\nsemantic class label of that instance. GivenP i, the modelΦpredicts instance-level outputs\nˆYi ={(ˆmi,j ,ˆci,j )}\nˆJi\nj=1, where ˆmi,j and ˆci,j denote the predicted mask and category label for\nthej-th instance, respectively. The number of predicted instances ˆJi varies depending on the\nmodel’s inference. The model is optimised using the following objective:\nL3DIS(D;Φ) = 1\n|D| ∑\n(P,Y)∈D\n1\n|Y| ∑\n(mj,cj)∈Y\n(Lmask(mj,ˆmj)+λ·L cls(cj,ˆcj)),(1)\nwhereL cls andL mask are the average classification and mask losses over all instances, andλ\ncontrols their trade-off. CI-3DIS.Unlike conventional 3DIS, CI-3DIS involves sequential learning, where object\ncategories are introduced incrementally overTtraining tasks. Each tasktintroduces a dis-\njoint set of classesC t , withC= ST\nt=1 Ct andC t ∩C t′\n=/ 0 fort̸=t ′. During each taskt, the THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D5\nmodel receives a datasetD t ={(P i,Yt\ni)}N\ni=1, where each coloured point cloudP i ∈R M×6\ncontainsMpoints, and the corresponding annotationY t\ni ={(m t\ni,j ,ct\ni,j )}\nJt\ni\nj=1 includes instance\nmasksm t\ni,j ∈ {0,1}M and semantic class labelsc t\ni,j ∈ Ct . The modelΦ t , initialized from\nΦt−1 , is trained onD t to predict instance-level outputs ˆYt\ni ={(ˆmt\ni,j ,ˆct\ni,j )}\nˆJt\ni\nj=1, where each\npredicted semantic label ˆct\ni,j belongs to the cumulative set of all classes observed so far:St\nk=1 Ck. The key challenge in this setup is to learn new classes without forgetting those\nencountered in previous tasks, despite limited supervision and the absence of past labels. 3.2 Method: CLIMB-3D\nOverview.As shown in Fig. 2 and formulated in Sec. 3.1, the proposed framework for\nCI-3DIS follows aphase-wisetraining strategy. In each phase, the model is exposed to a\ncarefully curated subset of the dataset, simulating real-world scenarios discussed in Sec. 3.3. Training naïvely on such phased data leads tocatastrophic forgetting[51], where the model\nforgets prior knowledge when learning new tasks. To address this, we first incorporateEx-\nemplar Replay(ER) [5], a strategy inspired by 2D incremental methods [1, 43, 54] and\nrecently extended to 3D settings [4], to mitigate forgetting by storing a small set of repre-\nsentative samples from earlier phases. However, ER alone is insufficient to achieve robust\nperformance. To address this, two additional components are introduced: aPseudo-Label\nGenerator(PLG), which leverages a frozen model to generate supervision signals for previ-\nously seen classes, and aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) module that compensates for\nclass imbalance across phases. Each of these components is described in detail below 1. Exemplar Replay (ER).Inspired by Buzzega et al. [5], ER addresses the issue of catas-\ntrophic forgetting by allowing the model to retain a subset of data from earlier phases. During phaset, the model is trained not only on the current task dataD t , but also on a\nset of exemplarsE 1:t−1, collected from previous phases. These exemplars are accumulated\nincrementally:E 1:t−1 =E 1 ∪···∪E t−1 .Here,E t denotes the exemplar subset stored after\nphaset, and|E t |denotes the exemplar replay size. The combined replay dataset is denoted\nas:D t\nER =D t ∪E 1:t−1.Epoch training consists of two stages: first, the model is trained on\nthe current data,D t ; then it is trained using exemplars fromE 1:t−1. While previous CI-3DIS approaches rely on large exemplar sets to mitigate forgetting [4],\nsuch strategies become impractical under memory constraints. Consequently, although ER\naids knowledge retention, it is insufficient on its own for robust performance with a limited\nexemplar budget. Therefore, PLG and CBR are introduced to better preserve past represen-\ntations and enhance generalisation across phases. Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG).In the CI-3DIS setting, during phaset(wheret>1),\nalthough ground-truth labels for previously seen classes are unavailable, the model from the\nprevious phaseΦ t−1 , which preserves knowledge of past tasks, is retained. We use this\nmodel to generate pseudo-labels for previously seen classes, thereby providing approximate\nsupervision during training. This allows the current modelΦt , to retain prior knowledge and\nreduce forgetting, even without access to ground-truth annotations. Given a point cloud and label pair(P,Y t ), fromD t , the previous modelΦ t−1 , generates\npseudo-labels for the previously seen classes as ˆY1:t−1 =Φ t−1 (P), which we denote as ˜Yt\n1For clarity, modifications introduced by each component (ER, PLG, and CBR) are highlighted in green, blue,\nand red, respectively. 6THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D\nfor brevity. However, we observe that utilising all predictions fromΦt−1 introduces noisy or\nincorrect labels, which degrade overall performance. To mitigate this, we select the top-K\nmost confident instance predictions, denoted as ˜Yt\nK, and concatenate them with the ground-\ntruth labels of the current task to obtain the supervision set: ¯Yt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt\nK. Following this,\nthe loss is computed over both the current task’s ground-truth labels and the top-Kconfi-\ndent pseudo-labels from earlier phases, enabling the model to retain prior knowledge while\nadapting to new classes. Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR).While ER and PLG contribute to preserving prior\nknowledge, we observe that the model’s predictions are biased towards frequent classes,\nresulting in the forgetting of rare categories. This issue is further amplified by the top-K\npseudo-labels selected by PLG, which predominantly represent dominant classes in the data. To address this, we propose aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) scheme that compensates\nfor class imbalance using object frequency statistics. At taskt, only the current datasetD t\nand its label distributionp t (c)over classesc∈ Ct are available. Datasets and class distribu-\ntions from earlier tasks{D i,p i(c)}t−1\ni=1 are no longer accessible, which makes it challenging\nto directly account for class imbalance across all previously seen tasks. Therefore, we pro-\npose to leverage the pseudo-label predictions of the frozen modelΦ t−1 as a proxy for the\nclass distribution across previously learned categories. During each training iteration, the previous modelΦ t−1 is applied to the current inputP\nto generate pseudo-labels ˜Yt , from which we accumulate class-wise frequency statistics for\npreviously learned classes. LetC1:t = St\ni=1 Ci represent the union of all classes seen up to task\nt. At the end of each epoch, we compute the overall class frequencyf∈R |C1:t | by combining\nthe pseudo-label distribution ˜pt (c)derived from ˜Yt with the ground-truth label distribution\npt (c)from the current task. The resulting frequency vectorf= [f(c)] c∈C1:t is then used to\ncompute class-wise weightsw= [w(c)] c∈C1:t , which guide balanced pseudo-label selection\nand help the model focus on rare classes. In the next epoch, the modelΦ t−1 produces soft pseudo-label predictions ˜Yt (as de-\nscribed in PLG) , where each component ˜Yt [c]denotes the confidence score for classc∈\nC1:t−1. To promote balanced pseudo-label selection, class-wise re-weighting is applied using\nw(c) = 1\nf(c)+ε , whereεis a small constant for numerical stability. The adjusted predictions\nare computed by applying the class-wise weights as: ˜Yt,w [c] =w(c)· ˜Yt [c],∀c∈ C 1:t−1. Top-Kselection is then applied to both the original and the re-weighted scores, yielding\ntwo pseudo-label sets: ˜Yt\nK and ˜Yt,w\nK , respectively. The final augmented target set, Yt , is\nconstructed by concatenating the ground-truth labelsY t with both sets of pseudo-labels:\nYt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt\nK ∥ ˜Yt,w\nK .(2)\nAlthough the above re-weighting mitigates bias from prior tasks, it does not address class\nimbalance within the current taskt. To resolve this, the class-balanced weightsw c are ex-\ntended to incorporate statistics from both previously seen and current classes, i.e., overC 1:t\nrather than onlyC 1:t−1. The updated weights, denoted asw ′\nc, are used to re-weights both\npseudo-label selection and classification loss, ensuring balanced supervision across all seen\ncategories, including rare ones. This unified strategy reduces bias and enhances performance\nacross phases. The pseudo-code for constructing the supervision set in Eq. (2), which incor-\nporates both PLG and CBR components, is provided in Appendix A.

Overall, our proposed\nmethod improves mAP by 5.6%. In this supplementary material, we first demonstrate the performance gains on rare classes\nachieved by incorporating the IC module in Appendix C. Next, we provide detailed split in-\nformation for all scenarios, based on class names, in Appendix D. Finally, we present a qual-\nitative comparison between the baseline method and our proposed approach in Appendix\nE. Appendix C Evaluation on Rare Categories\nThe proposed imbalance correction (IC) module, as detailed in Section 4.2, is designed to\naddress the performance gap for rare classes. To assess its impact, we compare its perfor-\nmance with the framework which has exemplar replay (ER) and knowledge distillation (KD). Specifically, we focus on its ability to improve performance for rare classes, which the model\nencounters infrequently compared to more common classes. The results, shown in Tab.\n\n5 and Tab. 6, correspond to evaluations onSplit-AforPhase\n2andPhase 3, respectively. InPhase 2, we evaluate classes seen 1–20 times per epoch,\nwhilePhase 3targets even less frequent classes, with observations limited to 1–10 times per\nepoch. As illustrated in Tab. 5, the IC module substantially improves performance on rare\nclasses in terms of mAP 50 in Phase 2 ofSplit-A. For instance, classes likerecycling\nbinandtrash bin, seen only 3 and 7 times, respectively, shows significant improvement\nwhen the IC module is applied. Overall, the IC module provides an average boost of 8.32%,\nhighlighting its effectiveness in mitigating class imbalance. Similarly, Tab. 6 presents results forPhase 3, demonstrating significant gains for infre-\nquent classes. For example, even though the classes such aspiano,bucket, andlaundry\nbasketare observed only once, IC module improves the performance by 52.30%, 10.40%,\nand 13.60%, respectively. The ER+KD module does not focus on rare classes likeshower\nandtoasterwhich results in low performance, but the IC module compensates for this imbal-\nance by focusing on underrepresented categories.

However, this assumption is unrealistic in dynamic, real-world environments where new\nclasses emerge gradually and exhibit natural imbalance. Although some approaches ad-\ndress the emergence of new classes, they often overlook class imbalance, which leads\nto suboptimal performance, particularly on rare categories. To tackle this, we propose\nCLIMB-3D, a unified framework forCLass-incrementalImbalance-aware3DIS. Build-\ning upon established exemplar replay (ER) strategies, we show that ER alone is insuf-\nficient to achieve robust performance under memory constraints. To mitigate this, we\nintroduce a novel pseudo-label generator (PLG) that extends supervision to previously\nlearned categories by leveraging predictions from a frozen model trained on prior tasks. Despite its promise, PLG tends to be biased towards frequent classes. Therefore, we\npropose a class-balanced re-weighting (CBR) scheme that estimates object frequencies\nfrom pseudo-labels and dynamically adjusts training bias, without requiring access to\npast data. We design and evaluate three incremental scenarios for 3DIS on the challeng-\ning ScanNet200 dataset and additionally validate our method for semantic segmentation\non ScanNetV2. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing prior work by\nup to 16.76% mAP for instance segmentation and approximately 30% mIoU for semantic\nsegmentation, demonstrating strong generalisation across both frequent and rare classes.

After every phase, the model must recognise both newly added\nand previously learned classes. For instance, in Task 2, categories such asPillow,Coffee\nTable, andSofa Chairare introduced, while the model is expected to retain recognition\nof earlier classes likeTable,Chair, andCouch. 3D instance segmentation (3DIS) is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves\nidentifying precise object boundaries and class labels in 3D space, with broad applications in\ngraphics, robotics, and augmented reality [4, 39]. Traditional 3DIS methods, including top-\ndown [28, 70, 78], bottom-up [26, 73], and transformer-based approaches [59], perform well\nunder the assumption that all classes are available and balanced during training. However,\nthis assumption does not hold in real-world environments, where new object classes emerge\nover time and exhibit natural imbalance. This gap motivates the need for Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) [17, 54], which sup-\nports learning new categories while retaining knowledge of previous ones [51]. While CIL\nhas seen success in 2D image tasks [1, 43, 54, 60], extensions to 3D point clouds remain\nlimited, often focusing on object-level classification [13, 18, 48]. Recent works on scene-\nlevel class-incremental 3DIS (CI-3DIS) [4] and class-incremental semantic segmentation\n(CI-3DSS) [74] show promise, but depend heavily on large exemplar [56] and overlook class\nimbalance, limiting their practicality. To address this, we proposeCLIMB-3D, a unified framework forCLass-incremental\nIMBalance-aware3DIS that jointly tackles catastrophic forgetting and class imbalance. The\nframework begins with Exemplar Replay (ER), storing a small number of samples from\npast classes for later replay. However, this alone does not yield promising results under the\nstrict memory constraints required in CI-3DIS. To address this, we introduce a Pseudo-Label\nGenerator (PLG), which uses a frozen model from previous task to generate supervision for\nearlier classes. However, we observed that PLG tends to favour frequent classes while ig-\nnoring under-represented ones. To mitigate this, we propose a Class-Balanced Re-weighting\n(CBR), which estimates class frequencies from the pseudo-labels to enhance the learning of\nrare classes without accessing past data. Together, these components form a practical and\neffective solution for real-world 3DIS. To evaluate CLIMB-3D, we designed three benchmark scenarios for CI-3DIS based on\nthe ScanNet200 dataset [57]. These scenarios simulate incremental learning setup under nat-\nural class imbalance, where new classes emerge based on (A) object frequency, (B) semantic\nsimilarity, or (C) random grouping. Additionally, for comparison with existing methods,\nwe evaluate our approach on CI-3DSS using the ScanNetV2 dataset [16]. Experimental re-\nsults show that our method significantly reduces forgetting and improves performance across\nboth frequent and rare categories, outperforming previous methods in both settings. Fig. 1\nillustrates the CI-3DIS setup. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D3\nIn summary, our contributions are: (i) a novel problem setting of imbalanced class-\nincremental 3DIS with an effective method to balance learning and mitigate forgetting; (ii)\nthree benchmarks modelling continual object emergence with natural imbalance; and (iii)\nstrong experimental results, achieving up to 16.76% mAP improvement over baselines. 2 Related Work\n3D Instance Segmentation.Various methods have been proposed for 3DIS. Grouping-\nbased approaches adopt a bottom-up pipeline that learns latent embeddings for point cluster-\ning [9, 21, 22, 29, 37, 44, 70, 78]. In contrast, proposal-based methods follow a top-down\nstrategy by detecting 3D boxes and segmenting objects within them [19, 26, 46, 73, 76]. Recently, transformer-based models [68] have also been applied to 3DIS and 3DSS [59, 64],\ninspired by advances in 2D vision [10, 11]. However, these approaches require full anno-\ntations for all classes and are not designed for progressive learning, where only new class\nannotations are available and previous data is inaccessible. Another line of work aims to re-\nduce annotation costs by proposing weakly supervised 3DIS methods based on sparse cues\n[12, 27, 72]. While effective with limited annotations, these methods assume a fixed set of\nclasses and are susceptible to catastrophic forgetting in incremental settings. Incremental Learning.Continual learning involves training models sequentially to miti-\ngate catastrophic forgetting. One common strategy is model regularisation, which constrains\nparameter updates using techniques such as elastic weight consolidation or knowledge dis-\ntillation [1, 24, 35, 43, 60]. Another approach is exemplar replay, where past data is stored\nor generated to rehearse older tasks while learning new ones [5, 7, 30, 54]. A third direc-\ntion involves dynamically expanding the model architecture or using modular sub-networks\nto accommodate new tasks without interfering with old ones [31, 42, 53, 58, 71, 79]. Re-\ncent efforts in class-incremental 3D segmentation [63, 74] have shown early promise but\noften rely on basic architectures and focus primarily on semantic segmentation. Other works\n[4, 36] explore continual learning in 3D settings, though they often depend on large memory\nbuffers. In contrast, our work introduces a tailored framework for 3D instance segmentation\nthat effectively transfers knowledge across tasks, even under class imbalance. Long-tailed Recognition.Imbalanced class distributions lead to poor recognition of rare\n(long-tail) classes. To address this, re-sampling methods balance the data via input [8, 20, 50,\n52, 61] or feature space [3, 14, 40], avoiding naïve under-/over-sampling. Loss re-weighting\noffers another direction, using class-based [6, 15, 23, 32, 33, 69] or per-example [45, 55, 62]\nadjustments to ensure fair contribution. Parameter regularisation improves generalisation\nthrough weight constraints [2], albeit requiring careful tuning. Other approaches leverage\ntransfer learning [77, 81], self-supervision [41, 75], or contrastive learning [34, 41, 82] to\nimprove rare-class representations. Long-tailed recognition is well-studied in 2D with large-\nscale datasets [15, 49, 67]; in 3D, ScanNet200 [16, 57] enables similar efforts. Prior 3D\nwork focused on re-weighting, re-sampling, and transfer learning [57], while regularisation\nremains underexplored. CeCo [80] balances class centres via auxiliary loss but overlooks\nsampling and augmentation. Lahoud et al. [38] propose adaptive classifier regularisation\nfor 3D segmentation, outperforming prior approaches without threshold tuning. However,\nneither method considers incremental learning. In contrast, we jointly address long-tail and\ncontinual 3D semantic segmentation. 4THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D\nFeature \nBackbone\nTransformer \nDecoder\nFeature \nBackbone\nTransformer \nDecoder\n(𝑷,𝒀𝑡)\nCurrent model (𝛷\n𝑡\n)\nPseudo Label Generator (PLG) \nSelection\n෨𝑌𝐾\n𝑡\nℒCI−3DIS\n෨𝑌𝐾\n𝑡,𝑤\nത𝑌𝐾\n𝑡\n෠𝑌𝑡\n(𝐷𝑡)\nCurrent Dataset \nExemplar \nReplay (ER)\n+\n~\nClass-Balanced  \nRe-weighting \n(CBR)\n1\n𝑓(𝑐)\nFigure 2: Overview ofCLIMB-3Dfor CI-3DIS. The model incrementally learns new classes\nacross sequential phases. During taskt, point cloudsPand their corresponding labelsY t are\nsampled from a combination of the current training datasetD t and Exemplar Replay (ER),\nwhich maintains a small memory of past examples. These are then passed to the current\nmodelΦ t to produce predicted labelsY t . The Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG) selects the\ntop-Kpredictions from the previous modelΦ t−1 . These pseudo-labels are then weighted\nbased on class frequencyf(c)using Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR), and the top-Kre-\nweighted labels are selected to form the balanced pseudo-label set ¯Yt . This pseudo-label set\nis then concatenated with the ground-truth labels to form a final augmented supervision set\nYt for taskt, which is used to optimise the modelΦ t using Eq. (3). 3 Methodology\n3.1 Problem Formulation\n3DIS.The objective of this task is to detect and segment each object instance within a point\ncloud. Formally, the training dataset is denoted asD={(P i,Yi)}N\ni=1, whereNis the number\nof training samples. Each inputP i ∈R M×6 is a coloured point cloud consisting ofMpoints,\nwhere each point is represented by its 3D coordinates and RGB values. The corresponding\nannotationY i ={(m i,j ,ci,j )}Ji\nj=1 containsJ i object instances, wheremi,j ∈ {0,1}M is a binary\nmask indicating which points belong to thej-th instance, andc i,j ∈ C={1,...,C}is the\nsemantic class label of that instance. GivenP i, the modelΦpredicts instance-level outputs\nˆYi ={(ˆmi,j ,ˆci,j )}\nˆJi\nj=1, where ˆmi,j and ˆci,j denote the predicted mask and category label for\nthej-th instance, respectively. The number of predicted instances ˆJi varies depending on the\nmodel’s inference. The model is optimised using the following objective:\nL3DIS(D;Φ) = 1\n|D| ∑\n(P,Y)∈D\n1\n|Y| ∑\n(mj,cj)∈Y\n(Lmask(mj,ˆmj)+λ·L cls(cj,ˆcj)),(1)\nwhereL cls andL mask are the average classification and mask losses over all instances, andλ\ncontrols their trade-off. CI-3DIS.Unlike conventional 3DIS, CI-3DIS involves sequential learning, where object\ncategories are introduced incrementally overTtraining tasks. Each tasktintroduces a dis-\njoint set of classesC t , withC= ST\nt=1 Ct andC t ∩C t′\n=/ 0 fort̸=t ′. During each taskt, the THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D5\nmodel receives a datasetD t ={(P i,Yt\ni)}N\ni=1, where each coloured point cloudP i ∈R M×6\ncontainsMpoints, and the corresponding annotationY t\ni ={(m t\ni,j ,ct\ni,j )}\nJt\ni\nj=1 includes instance\nmasksm t\ni,j ∈ {0,1}M and semantic class labelsc t\ni,j ∈ Ct . The modelΦ t , initialized from\nΦt−1 , is trained onD t to predict instance-level outputs ˆYt\ni ={(ˆmt\ni,j ,ˆct\ni,j )}\nˆJt\ni\nj=1, where each\npredicted semantic label ˆct\ni,j belongs to the cumulative set of all classes observed so far:St\nk=1 Ck. The key challenge in this setup is to learn new classes without forgetting those\nencountered in previous tasks, despite limited supervision and the absence of past labels. 3.2 Method: CLIMB-3D\nOverview.As shown in Fig. 2 and formulated in Sec. 3.1, the proposed framework for\nCI-3DIS follows aphase-wisetraining strategy. In each phase, the model is exposed to a\ncarefully curated subset of the dataset, simulating real-world scenarios discussed in Sec. 3.3. Training naïvely on such phased data leads tocatastrophic forgetting[51], where the model\nforgets prior knowledge when learning new tasks. To address this, we first incorporateEx-\nemplar Replay(ER) [5], a strategy inspired by 2D incremental methods [1, 43, 54] and\nrecently extended to 3D settings [4], to mitigate forgetting by storing a small set of repre-\nsentative samples from earlier phases. However, ER alone is insufficient to achieve robust\nperformance. To address this, two additional components are introduced: aPseudo-Label\nGenerator(PLG), which leverages a frozen model to generate supervision signals for previ-\nously seen classes, and aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) module that compensates for\nclass imbalance across phases. Each of these components is described in detail below 1. Exemplar Replay (ER).Inspired by Buzzega et al. [5], ER addresses the issue of catas-\ntrophic forgetting by allowing the model to retain a subset of data from earlier phases. During phaset, the model is trained not only on the current task dataD t , but also on a\nset of exemplarsE 1:t−1, collected from previous phases. These exemplars are accumulated\nincrementally:E 1:t−1 =E 1 ∪···∪E t−1 .Here,E t denotes the exemplar subset stored after\nphaset, and|E t |denotes the exemplar replay size. The combined replay dataset is denoted\nas:D t\nER =D t ∪E 1:t−1.Epoch training consists of two stages: first, the model is trained on\nthe current data,D t ; then it is trained using exemplars fromE 1:t−1. While previous CI-3DIS approaches rely on large exemplar sets to mitigate forgetting [4],\nsuch strategies become impractical under memory constraints. Consequently, although ER\naids knowledge retention, it is insufficient on its own for robust performance with a limited\nexemplar budget. Therefore, PLG and CBR are introduced to better preserve past represen-\ntations and enhance generalisation across phases. Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG).In the CI-3DIS setting, during phaset(wheret>1),\nalthough ground-truth labels for previously seen classes are unavailable, the model from the\nprevious phaseΦ t−1 , which preserves knowledge of past tasks, is retained. We use this\nmodel to generate pseudo-labels for previously seen classes, thereby providing approximate\nsupervision during training. This allows the current modelΦt , to retain prior knowledge and\nreduce forgetting, even without access to ground-truth annotations. Given a point cloud and label pair(P,Y t ), fromD t , the previous modelΦ t−1 , generates\npseudo-labels for the previously seen classes as ˆY1:t−1 =Φ t−1 (P), which we denote as ˜Yt\n1For clarity, modifications introduced by each component (ER, PLG, and CBR) are highlighted in green, blue,\nand red, respectively. 6THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D\nfor brevity. However, we observe that utilising all predictions fromΦt−1 introduces noisy or\nincorrect labels, which degrade overall performance. To mitigate this, we select the top-K\nmost confident instance predictions, denoted as ˜Yt\nK, and concatenate them with the ground-\ntruth labels of the current task to obtain the supervision set: ¯Yt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt\nK. Following this,\nthe loss is computed over both the current task’s ground-truth labels and the top-Kconfi-\ndent pseudo-labels from earlier phases, enabling the model to retain prior knowledge while\nadapting to new classes. Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR).While ER and PLG contribute to preserving prior\nknowledge, we observe that the model’s predictions are biased towards frequent classes,\nresulting in the forgetting of rare categories. This issue is further amplified by the top-K\npseudo-labels selected by PLG, which predominantly represent dominant classes in the data. To address this, we propose aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) scheme that compensates\nfor class imbalance using object frequency statistics. At taskt, only the current datasetD t\nand its label distributionp t (c)over classesc∈ Ct are available. Datasets and class distribu-\ntions from earlier tasks{D i,p i(c)}t−1\ni=1 are no longer accessible, which makes it challenging\nto directly account for class imbalance across all previously seen tasks. Therefore, we pro-\npose to leverage the pseudo-label predictions of the frozen modelΦ t−1 as a proxy for the\nclass distribution across previously learned categories. During each training iteration, the previous modelΦ t−1 is applied to the current inputP\nto generate pseudo-labels ˜Yt , from which we accumulate class-wise frequency statistics for\npreviously learned classes. LetC1:t = St\ni=1 Ci represent the union of all classes seen up to task\nt. At the end of each epoch, we compute the overall class frequencyf∈R |C1:t | by combining\nthe pseudo-label distribution ˜pt (c)derived from ˜Yt with the ground-truth label distribution\npt (c)from the current task. The resulting frequency vectorf= [f(c)] c∈C1:t is then used to\ncompute class-wise weightsw= [w(c)] c∈C1:t , which guide balanced pseudo-label selection\nand help the model focus on rare classes. In the next epoch, the modelΦ t−1 produces soft pseudo-label predictions ˜Yt (as de-\nscribed in PLG) , where each component ˜Yt [c]denotes the confidence score for classc∈\nC1:t−1. To promote balanced pseudo-label selection, class-wise re-weighting is applied using\nw(c) = 1\nf(c)+ε , whereεis a small constant for numerical stability. The adjusted predictions\nare computed by applying the class-wise weights as: ˜Yt,w [c] =w(c)· ˜Yt [c],∀c∈ C 1:t−1. Top-Kselection is then applied to both the original and the re-weighted scores, yielding\ntwo pseudo-label sets: ˜Yt\nK and ˜Yt,w\nK , respectively. The final augmented target set, Yt , is\nconstructed by concatenating the ground-truth labelsY t with both sets of pseudo-labels:\nYt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt\nK ∥ ˜Yt,w\nK .(2)\nAlthough the above re-weighting mitigates bias from prior tasks, it does not address class\nimbalance within the current taskt. To resolve this, the class-balanced weightsw c are ex-\ntended to incorporate statistics from both previously seen and current classes, i.e., overC 1:t\nrather than onlyC 1:t−1. The updated weights, denoted asw ′\nc, are used to re-weights both\npseudo-label selection and classification loss, ensuring balanced supervision across all seen\ncategories, including rare ones. This unified strategy reduces bias and enhances performance\nacross phases. The pseudo-code for constructing the supervision set in Eq. (2), which incor-\nporates both PLG and CBR components, is provided in Appendix A.
