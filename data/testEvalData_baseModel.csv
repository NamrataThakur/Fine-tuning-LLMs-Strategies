What is a limitation of transformer-based models applied to 3DIS and 3DSS?,"ing [9, 21, 22, 29, 37, 44, 70, 78]. In contrast, proposal-based methods follow a top-down strategy by detecting 3D boxes and segmenting objects within them [19, 26, 46, 73, 76]. Recently, transformer-based models [68] have also been applied to 3DIS and 3DSS [59, 64], inspired by advances in 2D vision [10, 11].

What does the combined replay dataset D ER consist of?,"phaset, and|E t |denotes the exemplar replay size. The combined replay dataset is denoted as:D t ER =D t ∪E 1:t−1.Epoch training consists of two stages: first, the model is trained on the current data,D t ; then it is trained using exemplars fromE 1:t−1. While previous CI-3DIS approaches rely on large exemplar sets to mitigate forgetting [4], such strategies become impractical under memory constraints. Consequently, although ER aids knowledge retention, it is insufficient on its own for robust performance with a limited exemplar budget. Therefore, PLG and CBR are introduced to better preserve past representations and enhance generalisation across phases.",The combined replay dataset D ER consists of D t ∪ E 1:t−1.,The combined replay dataset D ER consists of both current data (D t) and previous data from epochs prior to the current epoch (E 1:t−1).
