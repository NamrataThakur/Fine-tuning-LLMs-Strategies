What is the purpose of Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR) in CLIMB-3D?,['Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR) mitigates bias towards frequent classes by estimating class frequencies from pseudo-labels.'],"Based on the context, I can infer that Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR) is used to mitigate bias towards frequent classes by estimating class frequencies from pseudo-labels. This suggests that CBR is a technique used in the Context of the CLIMB-3D model.

* Reduce bias towards frequent classes
* Improve the performance of the model on imbalanced datasets
