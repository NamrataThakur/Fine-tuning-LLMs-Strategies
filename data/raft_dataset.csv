Abstract
While 3D instance segmentation (3DIS) has advanced significantly, most existing
methods assume that all object classes are known in advance and uniformly distributed. However, this assumption is unrealistic in dynamic, real-world environments where new
classes emerge gradually and exhibit natural imbalance. Although some approaches ad-
dress the emergence of new classes, they often overlook class imbalance, which leads
to suboptimal performance, particularly on rare categories. To tackle this, we propose
CLIMB-3D, a unified framework forCLass-incrementalImbalance-aware3DIS. Build-
ing upon established exemplar replay (ER) strategies, we show that ER alone is insuf-
ficient to achieve robust performance under memory constraints. To mitigate this, we
introduce a novel pseudo-label generator (PLG) that extends supervision to previously
learned categories by leveraging predictions from a frozen model trained on prior tasks. Despite its promise, PLG tends to be biased towards frequent classes. Therefore, we
propose a class-balanced re-weighting (CBR) scheme that estimates object frequencies
from pseudo-labels and dynamically adjusts training bias, without requiring access to
past data. We design and evaluate three incremental scenarios for 3DIS on the challeng-
ing ScanNet200 dataset and additionally validate our method for semantic segmentation
on ScanNetV2. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing prior work by
up to 16.76% mAP for instance segmentation and approximately 30% mIoU for semantic
segmentation, demonstrating strong generalisation across both frequent and rare classes. Code is available at:https://github.com/vgthengane/CLIMB3D. © 2025.

1 Introduction
Table Chair Couch Pillow Coffee Table Sofa Chair Recycling BinCabinet Unknown
Task-1 Task-2 Task-3
Figure 1:Overview of the CI-3DIS setting.New object categories are introduced incre-
mentally with each task. After every phase, the model must recognise both newly added
and previously learned classes. For instance, in Task 2, categories such asPillow,Coffee
Table, andSofa Chairare introduced, while the model is expected to retain recognition
of earlier classes likeTable,Chair, andCouch. 3D instance segmentation (3DIS) is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves
identifying precise object boundaries and class labels in 3D space, with broad applications in
graphics, robotics, and augmented reality [4, 39]. Traditional 3DIS methods, including top-
down [28, 70, 78], bottom-up [26, 73], and transformer-based approaches [59], perform well
under the assumption that all classes are available and balanced during training. However,
this assumption does not hold in real-world environments, where new object classes emerge
over time and exhibit natural imbalance. This gap motivates the need for Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) [17, 54], which sup-
ports learning new categories while retaining knowledge of previous ones [51]. While CIL
has seen success in 2D image tasks [1, 43, 54, 60], extensions to 3D point clouds remain
limited, often focusing on object-level classification [13, 18, 48]. Recent works on scene-
level class-incremental 3DIS (CI-3DIS) [4] and class-incremental semantic segmentation
(CI-3DSS) [74] show promise, but depend heavily on large exemplar [56] and overlook class
imbalance, limiting their practicality. To address this, we proposeCLIMB-3D, a unified framework forCLass-incremental
IMBalance-aware3DIS that jointly tackles catastrophic forgetting and class imbalance. The
framework begins with Exemplar Replay (ER), storing a small number of samples from
past classes for later replay. However, this alone does not yield promising results under the
strict memory constraints required in CI-3DIS. To address this, we introduce a Pseudo-Label
Generator (PLG), which uses a frozen model from previous task to generate supervision for
earlier classes. However, we observed that PLG tends to favour frequent classes while ig-
noring under-represented ones. To mitigate this, we propose a Class-Balanced Re-weighting
(CBR), which estimates class frequencies from the pseudo-labels to enhance the learning of
rare classes without accessing past data. Together, these components form a practical and
effective solution for real-world 3DIS. To evaluate CLIMB-3D, we designed three benchmark scenarios for CI-3DIS based on
the ScanNet200 dataset [57]. These scenarios simulate incremental learning setup under nat-
ural class imbalance, where new classes emerge based on (A) object frequency, (B) semantic
similarity, or (C) random grouping. Additionally, for comparison with existing methods,
we evaluate our approach on CI-3DSS using the ScanNetV2 dataset [16]. Experimental re-
sults show that our method significantly reduces forgetting and improves performance across
both frequent and rare categories, outperforming previous methods in both settings. Fig. 1
illustrates the CI-3DIS setup. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D3
In summary, our contributions are: (i) a novel problem setting of imbalanced class-
incremental 3DIS with an effective method to balance learning and mitigate forgetting; (ii)
three benchmarks modelling continual object emergence with natural imbalance; and (iii)
strong experimental results, achieving up to 16.76% mAP improvement over baselines. 2 Related Work
3D Instance Segmentation.Various methods have been proposed for 3DIS. Grouping-
based approaches adopt a bottom-up pipeline that learns latent embeddings for point cluster-
ing [9, 21, 22, 29, 37, 44, 70, 78]. In contrast, proposal-based methods follow a top-down
strategy by detecting 3D boxes and segmenting objects within them [19, 26, 46, 73, 76]. Recently, transformer-based models [68] have also been applied to 3DIS and 3DSS [59, 64],
inspired by advances in 2D vision [10, 11]. However, these approaches require full anno-
tations for all classes and are not designed for progressive learning, where only new class
annotations are available and previous data is inaccessible. Another line of work aims to re-
duce annotation costs by proposing weakly supervised 3DIS methods based on sparse cues
[12, 27, 72]. While effective with limited annotations, these methods assume a fixed set of
classes and are susceptible to catastrophic forgetting in incremental settings. Incremental Learning.Continual learning involves training models sequentially to miti-
gate catastrophic forgetting. One common strategy is model regularisation, which constrains
parameter updates using techniques such as elastic weight consolidation or knowledge dis-
tillation [1, 24, 35, 43, 60]. Another approach is exemplar replay, where past data is stored
or generated to rehearse older tasks while learning new ones [5, 7, 30, 54]. A third direc-
tion involves dynamically expanding the model architecture or using modular sub-networks
to accommodate new tasks without interfering with old ones [31, 42, 53, 58, 71, 79]. Re-
cent efforts in class-incremental 3D segmentation [63, 74] have shown early promise but
often rely on basic architectures and focus primarily on semantic segmentation. Other works
[4, 36] explore continual learning in 3D settings, though they often depend on large memory
buffers. In contrast, our work introduces a tailored framework for 3D instance segmentation
that effectively transfers knowledge across tasks, even under class imbalance. Long-tailed Recognition.Imbalanced class distributions lead to poor recognition of rare
(long-tail) classes. To address this, re-sampling methods balance the data via input [8, 20, 50,
52, 61] or feature space [3, 14, 40], avoiding naïve under-/over-sampling. Loss re-weighting
offers another direction, using class-based [6, 15, 23, 32, 33, 69] or per-example [45, 55, 62]
adjustments to ensure fair contribution. Parameter regularisation improves generalisation
through weight constraints [2], albeit requiring careful tuning. Other approaches leverage
transfer learning [77, 81], self-supervision [41, 75], or contrastive learning [34, 41, 82] to
improve rare-class representations. Long-tailed recognition is well-studied in 2D with large-
scale datasets [15, 49, 67]; in 3D, ScanNet200 [16, 57] enables similar efforts. Prior 3D
work focused on re-weighting, re-sampling, and transfer learning [57], while regularisation
remains underexplored. CeCo [80] balances class centres via auxiliary loss but overlooks
sampling and augmentation. Lahoud et al. [38] propose adaptive classifier regularisation
for 3D segmentation, outperforming prior approaches without threshold tuning. However,
neither method considers incremental learning. In contrast, we jointly address long-tail and
continual 3D semantic segmentation. 4THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D

Figure 2: Overview ofCLIMB-3Dfor CI-3DIS. The model incrementally learns new classes
across sequential phases. During taskt, point cloudsPand their corresponding labelsY t are
sampled from a combination of the current training datasetD t and Exemplar Replay (ER),
which maintains a small memory of past examples. These are then passed to the current
modelΦ t to produce predicted labelsY t . The Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG) selects the
top-Kpredictions from the previous modelΦ t−1 . These pseudo-labels are then weighted
based on class frequencyf(c)using Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR), and the top-Kre-
weighted labels are selected to form the balanced pseudo-label set ¯Yt . This pseudo-label set
is then concatenated with the ground-truth labels to form a final augmented supervision set
Yt for taskt, which is used to optimise the modelΦ t using Eq. (3). 3 Methodology
3.1 Problem Formulation
3DIS.The objective of this task is to detect and segment each object instance within a point
cloud. Formally, the training dataset is denoted asD={(P i,Yi)}N
i=1, whereNis the number
of training samples. Each inputP i ∈R M×6 is a coloured point cloud consisting ofMpoints,
where each point is represented by its 3D coordinates and RGB values. The corresponding
annotationY i ={(m i,j ,ci,j )}Ji
j=1 containsJ i object instances, wheremi,j ∈ {0,1}M is a binary
mask indicating which points belong to thej-th instance, andc i,j ∈ C={1,...,C}is the
semantic class label of that instance. GivenP i, the modelΦpredicts instance-level outputs
ˆYi ={(ˆmi,j ,ˆci,j )}
ˆJi
j=1, where ˆmi,j and ˆci,j denote the predicted mask and category label for
thej-th instance, respectively. The number of predicted instances ˆJi varies depending on the
model’s inference. The model is optimised using the following objective:
L3DIS(D;Φ) = 1

(P,Y)∈D

|Y| ∑
(mj,cj)∈Y
(Lmask(mj,ˆmj)+λ·L cls(cj,ˆcj)),(1)
whereL cls andL mask are the average classification and mask losses over all instances, andλ
controls their trade-off. CI-3DIS.Unlike conventional 3DIS, CI-3DIS involves sequential learning, where object
categories are introduced incrementally overTtraining tasks. Each tasktintroduces a dis-
joint set of classesC t , withC= ST

Overview.As shown in Fig. 2 and formulated in Sec. 3.1, the proposed framework for
CI-3DIS follows aphase-wisetraining strategy. In each phase, the model is exposed to a
carefully curated subset of the dataset, simulating real-world scenarios discussed in Sec. 3.3. Training naïvely on such phased data leads tocatastrophic forgetting[51], where the model
forgets prior knowledge when learning new tasks. To address this, we first incorporateEx-
emplar Replay(ER) [5], a strategy inspired by 2D incremental methods [1, 43, 54] and
recently extended to 3D settings [4], to mitigate forgetting by storing a small set of repre-
sentative samples from earlier phases. However, ER alone is insufficient to achieve robust
performance. To address this, two additional components are introduced: aPseudo-Label
Generator(PLG), which leverages a frozen model to generate supervision signals for previ-
ously seen classes, and aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) module that compensates for
class imbalance across phases. Each of these components is described in detail below 1. Exemplar Replay (ER).Inspired by Buzzega et al. [5], ER addresses the issue of catas-
trophic forgetting by allowing the model to retain a subset of data from earlier phases. During phaset, the model is trained not only on the current task dataD t , but also on a
set of exemplarsE 1:t−1, collected from previous phases. These exemplars are accumulated
incrementally:E 1:t−1 =E 1 ∪···∪E t−1 .Here,E t denotes the exemplar subset stored after
phaset, and|E t |denotes the exemplar replay size. The combined replay dataset is denoted
as:D t
ER =D t ∪E 1:t−1.Epoch training consists of two stages: first, the model is trained on
the current data,D t ; then it is trained using exemplars fromE 1:t−1. While previous CI-3DIS approaches rely on large exemplar sets to mitigate forgetting [4],
such strategies become impractical under memory constraints. Consequently, although ER
aids knowledge retention, it is insufficient on its own for robust performance with a limited
exemplar budget. Therefore, PLG and CBR are introduced to better preserve past represen-
tations and enhance generalisation across phases. Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG).In the CI-3DIS setting, during phaset(wheret>1),
although ground-truth labels for previously seen classes are unavailable, the model from the
previous phaseΦ t−1 , which preserves knowledge of past tasks, is retained. We use this
model to generate pseudo-labels for previously seen classes, thereby providing approximate
supervision during training. This allows the current modelΦt , to retain prior knowledge and
reduce forgetting, even without access to ground-truth annotations. Given a point cloud and label pair(P,Y t ), fromD t , the previous modelΦ t−1 , generates
pseudo-labels for the previously seen classes as ˆY1:t−1 =Φ t−1 (P), which we denote as ˜Yt
1For clarity, modifications introduced by each component (ER, PLG, and CBR) are highlighted in green, blue,
and red, respectively. 6THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D
for brevity. However, we observe that utilising all predictions fromΦt−1 introduces noisy or
incorrect labels, which degrade overall performance. To mitigate this, we select the top-K
most confident instance predictions, denoted as ˜Yt
K, and concatenate them with the ground-
truth labels of the current task to obtain the supervision set: ¯Yt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt
K. Following this,
the loss is computed over both the current task’s ground-truth labels and the top-Kconfi-
dent pseudo-labels from earlier phases, enabling the model to retain prior knowledge while
adapting to new classes. Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR).While ER and PLG contribute to preserving prior
knowledge, we observe that the model’s predictions are biased towards frequent classes,
resulting in the forgetting of rare categories. This issue is further amplified by the top-K
pseudo-labels selected by PLG, which predominantly represent dominant classes in the data. To address this, we propose aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) scheme that compensates
for class imbalance using object frequency statistics. At taskt, only the current datasetD t
and its label distributionp t (c)over classesc∈ Ct are available. Datasets and class distribu-
tions from earlier tasks{D i,p i(c)}t−1
i=1 are no longer accessible, which makes it challenging
to directly account for class imbalance across all previously seen tasks. Therefore, we pro-
pose to leverage the pseudo-label predictions of the frozen modelΦ t−1 as a proxy for the
class distribution across previously learned categories. During each training iteration, the previous modelΦ t−1 is applied to the current inputP
to generate pseudo-labels ˜Yt , from which we accumulate class-wise frequency statistics for
previously learned classes. LetC1:t = St
i=1 Ci represent the union of all classes seen up to task
t. At the end of each epoch, we compute the overall class frequencyf∈R |C1:t | by combining
the pseudo-label distribution ˜pt (c)derived from ˜Yt with the ground-truth label distribution
pt (c)from the current task. The resulting frequency vectorf= [f(c)] c∈C1:t is then used to
compute class-wise weightsw= [w(c)] c∈C1:t , which guide balanced pseudo-label selection
and help the model focus on rare classes. In the next epoch, the modelΦ t−1 produces soft pseudo-label predictions ˜Yt (as de-
scribed in PLG) , where each component ˜Yt [c]denotes the confidence score for classc∈
C1:t−1. To promote balanced pseudo-label selection, class-wise re-weighting is applied using
w(c) = 1
f(c)+ε , whereεis a small constant for numerical stability. The adjusted predictions
are computed by applying the class-wise weights as: ˜Yt,w [c] =w(c)· ˜Yt [c],∀c∈ C 1:t−1. Top-Kselection is then applied to both the original and the re-weighted scores, yielding
two pseudo-label sets: ˜Yt
K and ˜Yt,w
K , respectively. The final augmented target set, Yt , is
constructed by concatenating the ground-truth labelsY t with both sets of pseudo-labels:
Yt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt
K ∥ ˜Yt,w
K .(2)
Although the above re-weighting mitigates bias from prior tasks, it does not address class
imbalance within the current taskt. To resolve this, the class-balanced weightsw c are ex-
tended to incorporate statistics from both previously seen and current classes, i.e., overC 1:t
rather than onlyC 1:t−1. The updated weights, denoted asw ′
c, are used to re-weights both
pseudo-label selection and classification loss, ensuring balanced supervision across all seen
categories, including rare ones. This unified strategy reduces bias and enhances performance
across phases. The pseudo-code for constructing the supervision set in Eq. (2), which incor-
porates both PLG and CBR components, is provided in Appendix A. Final Objective.The final training objective ofCLIMB-3D, incorporating ER, PLG, and THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D7

While CI-3DIS methods offer a wide range of practical applications, they frequently rely
on the assumption of uniform sample distribution, which rarely holds in real-world settings. In practice, the number of object categories, denoted byC, is often large and characterised
by substantial variability in category frequency, shape, structure, and size. To address these
challenges, we propose three incremental learning scenarios, each designed to capture a
different facet of real-world complexity. The design of these scenarios is detailed below; for
further information and illustrations, refer to Appendix E of the supplementary material. Split-A: Frequency Scenarios.This scenario acknowledges that datasets are often la-
belled based on the frequency of categories. To accommodate this, we propose a split where
the model learns from the most frequent categories and subsequently incorporates the less
frequent ones in later stages. By prioritising the training of frequently occurring categories,
the model can establish a strong foundation before expanding to handle rare categories. Split-B: Semantic Scenarios.Beyond frequency, semantic similarity is crucial in real-
world deployments. While objects often share visual or functional traits, models may en-
counter semantically different categories in new environments. To simulate this challenge,
we introduce theSplit-Bscenario. Here, categories are grouped based on their semantic
relationships, and the model is incrementally trained on one semantic group at a time. This
setup encourages the model to generalise across semantically similar categories and adapt
more effectively when exposed to new ones. Unlike theSplit-Ascenario, which organises
learning based on category frequency, theSplit-Bscenario may contain both frequent and
infrequent categories within a single task, focusing on semantic continuity and transfer. Split-C: Random Scenarios.In some cases, data labelling is driven by the availability of
objects rather than predefined criteria. To capture this, we introduce theSplit-Cscenario,
which represents a fully random setting where any class can appear in any task, resulting in
varying levels of class imbalance. By exposing the model to such diverse and unpredictable
distributions, we aim to improve its robustness in real-world situations where labelled data
availability is inconsistent. These incremental scenarios are designed to provide a more realistic representation of
object distributions, frequencies, and dynamics encountered in the real world. 4 Experiments

assessing real-world scenarios. In addition, we compare our approach against existing in-
cremental learning methods using ScanNetV2 [16] in the 3DSS setting. For this evaluation,
we follow the standard training and validation splits defined in prior works [74] to ensure
consistency with existing methods. Evaluation Metrics.We evaluate our method usingMean Average Precision(mAP), a
standard metric for 3DIS which provides a comprehensive measure of segmentation quality
by accounting for both precision and recall. For comparison with existing 3DSS methods,
we report themean Intersection over Union(mIoU), which quantifies the overlap between
predicted and ground truth segments. To assess the model’s ability to mitigate catastrophic
forgetting in incremental settings, we use theForgetting Percentage Points(FPP) metric, as
defined in [47]. FPP captures performance degradation by measuring the accuracy drop on
the initially seen categories between the first and final training phases. Detailed descriptions of the incremental scenarios (Split-A,Split-B,Split-C) and im-
plementation are provided in Appendix B. 4.2 Results and Discussion

To evaluate our proposed approach, we construct a baseline using ER [5] for the 3DIS
setting, as no existing incremental baselines are available for this task. In contrast, for the
3DSS setting, where incremental baselines do exist, we compare our method against three
prior approaches [43, 60, 74]. Results on CI-3DIS.Tab. 1 compares CLIMB-3D against the ER baseline across the three
CI-3DIS scenarios, evaluated after all phases using mAP 25, mAP50, overall mAP, and FPP. In theSplit-Ascenario, characterised by significant distribution shifts, our method achieves
gains of +19.23%, +16.76%, and +12.28% in mAP 25, mAP 50, and overall mAP, respec-
tively, while drastically reducing forgetting with FPP scores of 3.44% (mAP 25) and 2.63%
(mAP50), both over 45 points lower than the baseline. Under theSplit-Bscenario, with
semantically related new categories, improvements of +18.26%, +16.49%, and +12.76%
are observed alongside a reduction in forgetting to 8.00% and 5.51% from baseline levels
above 42%. For theSplit-Cscenario, featuring increasing geometric complexity, CLIMB-
3D maintains solid gains of +5.94%, +5.70%, and +4.08% across mAP metrics, with forget-
ting reduced by over 22 points. Overall, these results demonstrate robust forward transfer,
minimal forgetting, and stable learning, highlighting the method’s effectiveness for scalable
continual 3D semantic understanding. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D9

Results on CI-3DSS.Although our primary focus is on CI-3DIS, we also evaluate our
method under the CI-3DSS setting to enable comparisons with existing approaches. To do
so, we adapt our predictions to assign each point the label corresponding to the highest-
confidence mask and exclude background classes (e.g., floor and wall), as these are not part
of the semantic segmentation targets. Tab. 2 presents a comparison between our method and
existing baselines on the ScanNet V2 dataset [16], evaluated using mIoU across two training
phases and overall. Although originally designed for instance segmentation, our method
generalises effectively to semantic segmentation, achieving substantial gains of +35.23%
mIoU in Phase 1 and +19.1% in Phase 2. Overall, it achieves 59.38% mIoU, significantly
higher than the∼30% mIoU of prior methods, highlighting its robustness and transferability. Refer to Appendix C, D, and F of the supplementary material for detailed analyses of per-
phase performance, rare-class evaluation, and qualitative result comparisons, respectively. 4.3 Ablation

We conduct an ablation study to evaluate the contribution of each component in our
framework. As an upper bound, we report the performance of anOraclemodel, which is
trained jointly on the full dataset. For the incremental setting, we follow the previously
defined splits and first train the model naively across phases. We then incrementally add
each module to isolate its impact. Tab. 3 presents results for theSplit-Ascenario using both
mAP50 and FPP metrics. Naïve Training.When trained naïvely without any dedicated modules, the model suffers
from severe catastrophic forgetting, as evident in row 2. The model entirely forgets pre-
viously learned classes upon entering new phases, with performance dropping to zero for
earlier splits and FPP rising to 56.82. 10THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D
Effect of ER.Adding exemplar replay (row 3) partially alleviates forgetting by maintaining
a buffer of past examples. This yields notable gains fors1in Phase 2 (+18.51%) and Phase 3
(+10.38%), and also improvess2in Phase 3 (+9.43%). However, the overall forgetting
remains substantial (FPP: 46.44), showing ER alone is insufficient. Effect of PLG.The addition of the pseudo-label generator (PLG), which generates labels for
previous classes by retaining a copy of the model from an earlier phase, facilitates knowledge
retention and forward transfer. As shown in row 4, PLG significantly reduces forgetting and
enhances performance on current tasks. Fors1, it improves mAP 50 by 31.49% in Phase 2
and 39.40% in Phase 3 over exemplar replay. Overall, PLG yields a 15.00% increase in
performance and reduces forgetting by 39.40%. Effect of CBR.Finally, class-balanced re-weighting (CBR) mitigates class imbalance dur-
ing both pseudo-labelling and current task learning by adjusting each class’s contribution
based on its frequency. As shown in row 5, CBR enhancess1retention over PLG in Phases 2
and 3 (+4.67% and +4.41%), and further improves performance ons2ands3. It also achieves
the lowest FPP of 2.63, reflecting strong forgetting mitigation. Overall, CBR offers the best
trade-off between retaining past knowledge and acquiring new tasks, outperforming PLG
and ER by 4.41% and 43.81%, respectively. 4.4 Limitations & Future Work
While CLIMB-3D achieves strong performance across CI-3DIS and CI-3DSS settings, sev-
eral limitations remain and warrant discussion. The experiments are currently limited to
indoor datasets (ScanNet200 and ScanNetV2), therefore evaluating performance on outdoor
scenes would help assess generalisability across diverse environments. The current setup
also considers only three incremental phases, whereas real-world applications often involve
longer sequences; incorporating such extended setups would better reflect practical chal-
lenges. Moreover, the model operates in a uni-modal setting. Integrating multi-modal cues,
such as vision-language models, could further enhance performance, as suggested by recent
2D and 3D studies [25, 65, 66]. 5 Conclusion
This work addresses the challenge of catastrophic forgetting in class-incremental 3D in-
stance segmentation by introducing a modular framework that integrates exemplar replay
(ER), a pseudo-label generator (PLG), and class-balanced re-weighting (CBR). The pro-
posed method incrementally adapts to new classes while preserving prior knowledge, all
without requiring access to the full dataset. Extensive experiments on a three-phase bench-
mark validate the individual and combined effectiveness of each component: ER enables
efficient memory-based retention; PLG facilitates knowledge preservation through pseudo-
supervision; and CBR mitigates class imbalance to enhance learning stability. Together,
these components significantly reduce forgetting and improve segmentation performance
across all phases. By achieving a strong balance between stability and plasticity, our ap-
proach advances continual 3D scene understanding and sets a new baseline for future re-
search in this area. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D11

Abstract
While 3D instance segmentation (3DIS) has advanced significantly, most existing
methods assume that all object classes are known in advance and uniformly distributed. However, this assumption is unrealistic in dynamic, real-world environments where new
classes emerge gradually and exhibit natural imbalance. Although some approaches ad-
dress the emergence of new classes, they often overlook class imbalance, which leads
to suboptimal performance, particularly on rare categories. To tackle this, we propose
CLIMB-3D, a unified framework forCLass-incrementalImbalance-aware3DIS. Build-
ing upon established exemplar replay (ER) strategies, we show that ER alone is insuf-
ficient to achieve robust performance under memory constraints. To mitigate this, we
introduce a novel pseudo-label generator (PLG) that extends supervision to previously
learned categories by leveraging predictions from a frozen model trained on prior tasks. Despite its promise, PLG tends to be biased towards frequent classes. Therefore, we
propose a class-balanced re-weighting (CBR) scheme that estimates object frequencies
from pseudo-labels and dynamically adjusts training bias, without requiring access to
past data. We design and evaluate three incremental scenarios for 3DIS on the challeng-
ing ScanNet200 dataset and additionally validate our method for semantic segmentation
on ScanNetV2. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing prior work by
up to 16.76% mAP for instance segmentation and approximately 30% mIoU for semantic
segmentation, demonstrating strong generalisation across both frequent and rare classes. Code is available at:https://github.com/vgthengane/CLIMB3D. © 2025.

whilePhase 3targets even less frequent classes, with observations limited to 1–10 times per
epoch. As illustrated in Tab. 5, the IC module substantially improves performance on rare
classes in terms of mAP 50 in Phase 2 ofSplit-A. For instance, classes likerecycling

when the IC module is applied. Overall, the IC module provides an average boost of 8.32%,

Abstract
While 3D instance segmentation (3DIS) has advanced significantly, most existing
methods assume that all object classes are known in advance and uniformly distributed. However, this assumption is unrealistic in dynamic, real-world environments where new
classes emerge gradually and exhibit natural imbalance. Although some approaches ad-
dress the emergence of new classes, they often overlook class imbalance, which leads
to suboptimal performance, particularly on rare categories. To tackle this, we propose
CLIMB-3D, a unified framework forCLass-incrementalImbalance-aware3DIS. Build-
ing upon established exemplar replay (ER) strategies, we show that ER alone is insuf-
ficient to achieve robust performance under memory constraints. To mitigate this, we
introduce a novel pseudo-label generator (PLG) that extends supervision to previously
learned categories by leveraging predictions from a frozen model trained on prior tasks. Despite its promise, PLG tends to be biased towards frequent classes. Therefore, we
propose a class-balanced re-weighting (CBR) scheme that estimates object frequencies
from pseudo-labels and dynamically adjusts training bias, without requiring access to
past data. We design and evaluate three incremental scenarios for 3DIS on the challeng-
ing ScanNet200 dataset and additionally validate our method for semantic segmentation
on ScanNetV2. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing prior work by
up to 16.76% mAP for instance segmentation and approximately 30% mIoU for semantic
segmentation, demonstrating strong generalisation across both frequent and rare classes. Code is available at:https://github.com/vgthengane/CLIMB3D. © 2025.

Abstract
While 3D instance segmentation (3DIS) has advanced significantly, most existing
methods assume that all object classes are known in advance and uniformly distributed. However, this assumption is unrealistic in dynamic, real-world environments where new
classes emerge gradually and exhibit natural imbalance. Although some approaches ad-
dress the emergence of new classes, they often overlook class imbalance, which leads
to suboptimal performance, particularly on rare categories. To tackle this, we propose
CLIMB-3D, a unified framework forCLass-incrementalImbalance-aware3DIS. Build-
ing upon established exemplar replay (ER) strategies, we show that ER alone is insuf-
ficient to achieve robust performance under memory constraints. To mitigate this, we
introduce a novel pseudo-label generator (PLG) that extends supervision to previously
learned categories by leveraging predictions from a frozen model trained on prior tasks. Despite its promise, PLG tends to be biased towards frequent classes. Therefore, we
propose a class-balanced re-weighting (CBR) scheme that estimates object frequencies
from pseudo-labels and dynamically adjusts training bias, without requiring access to
past data. We design and evaluate three incremental scenarios for 3DIS on the challeng-
ing ScanNet200 dataset and additionally validate our method for semantic segmentation
on ScanNetV2. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing prior work by
up to 16.76% mAP for instance segmentation and approximately 30% mIoU for semantic
segmentation, demonstrating strong generalisation across both frequent and rare classes. Code is available at:https://github.com/vgthengane/CLIMB3D. © 2025.

on individual splits across various scenarios. The results clearly demonstrate that our model
consistently retains knowledge of previous tasks better than the baseline. ForSplit-A, our
model shows improvement throughout the phase. In Phase 3 of (s2), although both the base-
line and our method exhibit a performance drop, our method reduces forgetting significantly
compared to the baseline. TheSplit-Bscenario, while more complex thanSplit-A, achieves
comparable results due to semantic similarity among classes within the same task. In Phase

trend is observed in Phase 3, where our method not only consistently improves learning but
also enhances retention of previous information. After all three tasks, our method achieves
an overall performance of 31.56% AP50, compared to 15.07% for the baseline. In theSplit-

Figure 1:Overview of the CI-3DIS setting.New object categories are introduced incre-
mentally with each task. After every phase, the model must recognise both newly added
and previously learned classes. For instance, in Task 2, categories such asPillow,Coffee
Table, andSofa Chairare introduced, while the model is expected to retain recognition
of earlier classes likeTable,Chair, andCouch. 3D instance segmentation (3DIS) is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves
identifying precise object boundaries and class labels in 3D space, with broad applications in
graphics, robotics, and augmented reality [4, 39]. Traditional 3DIS methods, including top-
down [28, 70, 78], bottom-up [26, 73], and transformer-based approaches [59], perform well
under the assumption that all classes are available and balanced during training. However,
this assumption does not hold in real-world environments, where new object classes emerge
over time and exhibit natural imbalance. This gap motivates the need for Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) [17, 54], which sup-
ports learning new categories while retaining knowledge of previous ones [51]. While CIL
has seen success in 2D image tasks [1, 43, 54, 60], extensions to 3D point clouds remain
limited, often focusing on object-level classification [13, 18, 48]. Recent works on scene-
level class-incremental 3DIS (CI-3DIS) [4] and class-incremental semantic segmentation
(CI-3DSS) [74] show promise, but depend heavily on large exemplar [56] and overlook class
imbalance, limiting their practicality. To address this, we proposeCLIMB-3D, a unified framework forCLass-incremental
IMBalance-aware3DIS that jointly tackles catastrophic forgetting and class imbalance. The
framework begins with Exemplar Replay (ER), storing a small number of samples from
past classes for later replay. However, this alone does not yield promising results under the
strict memory constraints required in CI-3DIS. To address this, we introduce a Pseudo-Label
Generator (PLG), which uses a frozen model from previous task to generate supervision for
earlier classes. However, we observed that PLG tends to favour frequent classes while ig-
noring under-represented ones. To mitigate this, we propose a Class-Balanced Re-weighting
(CBR), which estimates class frequencies from the pseudo-labels to enhance the learning of
rare classes without accessing past data. Together, these components form a practical and
effective solution for real-world 3DIS. To evaluate CLIMB-3D, we designed three benchmark scenarios for CI-3DIS based on
the ScanNet200 dataset [57]. These scenarios simulate incremental learning setup under nat-
ural class imbalance, where new classes emerge based on (A) object frequency, (B) semantic
similarity, or (C) random grouping. Additionally, for comparison with existing methods,
we evaluate our approach on CI-3DSS using the ScanNetV2 dataset [16]. Experimental re-
sults show that our method significantly reduces forgetting and improves performance across
both frequent and rare categories, outperforming previous methods in both settings. Fig. 1
illustrates the CI-3DIS setup. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D3
In summary, our contributions are: (i) a novel problem setting of imbalanced class-
incremental 3DIS with an effective method to balance learning and mitigate forgetting; (ii)
three benchmarks modelling continual object emergence with natural imbalance; and (iii)
strong experimental results, achieving up to 16.76% mAP improvement over baselines. 2 Related Work
3D Instance Segmentation.Various methods have been proposed for 3DIS. Grouping-
based approaches adopt a bottom-up pipeline that learns latent embeddings for point cluster-
ing [9, 21, 22, 29, 37, 44, 70, 78]. In contrast, proposal-based methods follow a top-down
strategy by detecting 3D boxes and segmenting objects within them [19, 26, 46, 73, 76]. Recently, transformer-based models [68] have also been applied to 3DIS and 3DSS [59, 64],
inspired by advances in 2D vision [10, 11]. However, these approaches require full anno-
tations for all classes and are not designed for progressive learning, where only new class
annotations are available and previous data is inaccessible. Another line of work aims to re-
duce annotation costs by proposing weakly supervised 3DIS methods based on sparse cues
[12, 27, 72]. While effective with limited annotations, these methods assume a fixed set of
classes and are susceptible to catastrophic forgetting in incremental settings. Incremental Learning.Continual learning involves training models sequentially to miti-
gate catastrophic forgetting. One common strategy is model regularisation, which constrains
parameter updates using techniques such as elastic weight consolidation or knowledge dis-
tillation [1, 24, 35, 43, 60]. Another approach is exemplar replay, where past data is stored
or generated to rehearse older tasks while learning new ones [5, 7, 30, 54]. A third direc-
tion involves dynamically expanding the model architecture or using modular sub-networks
to accommodate new tasks without interfering with old ones [31, 42, 53, 58, 71, 79]. Re-
cent efforts in class-incremental 3D segmentation [63, 74] have shown early promise but
often rely on basic architectures and focus primarily on semantic segmentation. Other works
[4, 36] explore continual learning in 3D settings, though they often depend on large memory
buffers. In contrast, our work introduces a tailored framework for 3D instance segmentation
that effectively transfers knowledge across tasks, even under class imbalance. Long-tailed Recognition.Imbalanced class distributions lead to poor recognition of rare
(long-tail) classes. To address this, re-sampling methods balance the data via input [8, 20, 50,
52, 61] or feature space [3, 14, 40], avoiding naïve under-/over-sampling. Loss re-weighting
offers another direction, using class-based [6, 15, 23, 32, 33, 69] or per-example [45, 55, 62]
adjustments to ensure fair contribution. Parameter regularisation improves generalisation
through weight constraints [2], albeit requiring careful tuning. Other approaches leverage
transfer learning [77, 81], self-supervision [41, 75], or contrastive learning [34, 41, 82] to
improve rare-class representations. Long-tailed recognition is well-studied in 2D with large-
scale datasets [15, 49, 67]; in 3D, ScanNet200 [16, 57] enables similar efforts. Prior 3D
work focused on re-weighting, re-sampling, and transfer learning [57], while regularisation
remains underexplored. CeCo [80] balances class centres via auxiliary loss but overlooks
sampling and augmentation. Lahoud et al. [38] propose adaptive classifier regularisation
for 3D segmentation, outperforming prior approaches without threshold tuning. However,
neither method considers incremental learning. In contrast, we jointly address long-tail and
continual 3D semantic segmentation. 4THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D

sampled from a combination of the current training datasetD t and Exemplar Replay (ER),
which maintains a small memory of past examples. These are then passed to the current

top-Kpredictions from the previous modelΦ t−1 . These pseudo-labels are then weighted
based on class frequencyf(c)using Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR), and the top-Kre-
weighted labels are selected to form the balanced pseudo-label set ¯Yt . This pseudo-label set
is then concatenated with the ground-truth labels to form a final augmented supervision set
Yt for taskt, which is used to optimise the modelΦ t using Eq. (3). 3 Methodology
3.1 Problem Formulation
3DIS.The objective of this task is to detect and segment each object instance within a point
cloud. Formally, the training dataset is denoted asD={(P i,Yi)}N
i=1, whereNis the number
of training samples. Each inputP i ∈R M×6 is a coloured point cloud consisting ofMpoints,
where each point is represented by its 3D coordinates and RGB values. The corresponding
annotationY i ={(m i,j ,ci,j )}Ji
j=1 containsJ i object instances, wheremi,j ∈ {0,1}M is a binary
mask indicating which points belong to thej-th instance, andc i,j ∈ C={1,...,C}is the
semantic class label of that instance. GivenP i, the modelΦpredicts instance-level outputs
ˆYi ={(ˆmi,j ,ˆci,j )}
ˆJi
j=1, where ˆmi,j and ˆci,j denote the predicted mask and category label for
thej-th instance, respectively. The number of predicted instances ˆJi varies depending on the
model’s inference. The model is optimised using the following objective:
L3DIS(D;Φ) = 1

(Lmask(mj,ˆmj)+λ·L cls(cj,ˆcj)),(1)
whereL cls andL mask are the average classification and mask losses over all instances, andλ
controls their trade-off. CI-3DIS.Unlike conventional 3DIS, CI-3DIS involves sequential learning, where object
categories are introduced incrementally overTtraining tasks. Each tasktintroduces a dis-
joint set of classesC t , withC= ST

Overview.As shown in Fig. 2 and formulated in Sec. 3.1, the proposed framework for
CI-3DIS follows aphase-wisetraining strategy. In each phase, the model is exposed to a
carefully curated subset of the dataset, simulating real-world scenarios discussed in Sec. 3.3. Training naïvely on such phased data leads tocatastrophic forgetting[51], where the model
forgets prior knowledge when learning new tasks. To address this, we first incorporateEx-
emplar Replay(ER) [5], a strategy inspired by 2D incremental methods [1, 43, 54] and
recently extended to 3D settings [4], to mitigate forgetting by storing a small set of repre-
sentative samples from earlier phases. However, ER alone is insufficient to achieve robust
performance. To address this, two additional components are introduced: aPseudo-Label
Generator(PLG), which leverages a frozen model to generate supervision signals for previ-
ously seen classes, and aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) module that compensates for
class imbalance across phases. Each of these components is described in detail below 1. Exemplar Replay (ER).Inspired by Buzzega et al. [5], ER addresses the issue of catas-
trophic forgetting by allowing the model to retain a subset of data from earlier phases. During phaset, the model is trained not only on the current task dataD t , but also on a
set of exemplarsE 1:t−1, collected from previous phases. These exemplars are accumulated
incrementally:E 1:t−1 =E 1 ∪···∪E t−1 .Here,E t denotes the exemplar subset stored after
phaset, and|E t |denotes the exemplar replay size. The combined replay dataset is denoted
as:D t
ER =D t ∪E 1:t−1.Epoch training consists of two stages: first, the model is trained on
the current data,D t ; then it is trained using exemplars fromE 1:t−1. While previous CI-3DIS approaches rely on large exemplar sets to mitigate forgetting [4],
such strategies become impractical under memory constraints. Consequently, although ER
aids knowledge retention, it is insufficient on its own for robust performance with a limited
exemplar budget. Therefore, PLG and CBR are introduced to better preserve past represen-
tations and enhance generalisation across phases. Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG).In the CI-3DIS setting, during phaset(wheret>1),
although ground-truth labels for previously seen classes are unavailable, the model from the
previous phaseΦ t−1 , which preserves knowledge of past tasks, is retained. We use this
model to generate pseudo-labels for previously seen classes, thereby providing approximate
supervision during training. This allows the current modelΦt , to retain prior knowledge and
reduce forgetting, even without access to ground-truth annotations. Given a point cloud and label pair(P,Y t ), fromD t , the previous modelΦ t−1 , generates
pseudo-labels for the previously seen classes as ˆY1:t−1 =Φ t−1 (P), which we denote as ˜Yt
1For clarity, modifications introduced by each component (ER, PLG, and CBR) are highlighted in green, blue,
and red, respectively. 6THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D
for brevity. However, we observe that utilising all predictions fromΦt−1 introduces noisy or
incorrect labels, which degrade overall performance. To mitigate this, we select the top-K
most confident instance predictions, denoted as ˜Yt
K, and concatenate them with the ground-
truth labels of the current task to obtain the supervision set: ¯Yt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt
K. Following this,
the loss is computed over both the current task’s ground-truth labels and the top-Kconfi-
dent pseudo-labels from earlier phases, enabling the model to retain prior knowledge while
adapting to new classes. Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR).While ER and PLG contribute to preserving prior
knowledge, we observe that the model’s predictions are biased towards frequent classes,
resulting in the forgetting of rare categories. This issue is further amplified by the top-K
pseudo-labels selected by PLG, which predominantly represent dominant classes in the data. To address this, we propose aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) scheme that compensates
for class imbalance using object frequency statistics. At taskt, only the current datasetD t
and its label distributionp t (c)over classesc∈ Ct are available. Datasets and class distribu-
tions from earlier tasks{D i,p i(c)}t−1
i=1 are no longer accessible, which makes it challenging
to directly account for class imbalance across all previously seen tasks. Therefore, we pro-
pose to leverage the pseudo-label predictions of the frozen modelΦ t−1 as a proxy for the
class distribution across previously learned categories. During each training iteration, the previous modelΦ t−1 is applied to the current inputP
to generate pseudo-labels ˜Yt , from which we accumulate class-wise frequency statistics for
previously learned classes. LetC1:t = St
i=1 Ci represent the union of all classes seen up to task
t. At the end of each epoch, we compute the overall class frequencyf∈R |C1:t | by combining
the pseudo-label distribution ˜pt (c)derived from ˜Yt with the ground-truth label distribution
pt (c)from the current task. The resulting frequency vectorf= [f(c)] c∈C1:t is then used to
compute class-wise weightsw= [w(c)] c∈C1:t , which guide balanced pseudo-label selection
and help the model focus on rare classes. In the next epoch, the modelΦ t−1 produces soft pseudo-label predictions ˜Yt (as de-
scribed in PLG) , where each component ˜Yt [c]denotes the confidence score for classc∈
C1:t−1. To promote balanced pseudo-label selection, class-wise re-weighting is applied using
w(c) = 1
f(c)+ε , whereεis a small constant for numerical stability. The adjusted predictions
are computed by applying the class-wise weights as: ˜Yt,w [c] =w(c)· ˜Yt [c],∀c∈ C 1:t−1. Top-Kselection is then applied to both the original and the re-weighted scores, yielding
two pseudo-label sets: ˜Yt
K and ˜Yt,w
K , respectively. The final augmented target set, Yt , is
constructed by concatenating the ground-truth labelsY t with both sets of pseudo-labels:
Yt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt
K ∥ ˜Yt,w
K .(2)
Although the above re-weighting mitigates bias from prior tasks, it does not address class
imbalance within the current taskt. To resolve this, the class-balanced weightsw c are ex-
tended to incorporate statistics from both previously seen and current classes, i.e., overC 1:t
rather than onlyC 1:t−1. The updated weights, denoted asw ′
c, are used to re-weights both
pseudo-label selection and classification loss, ensuring balanced supervision across all seen
categories, including rare ones. This unified strategy reduces bias and enhances performance
across phases. The pseudo-code for constructing the supervision set in Eq. (2), which incor-
porates both PLG and CBR components, is provided in Appendix A. Final Objective.The final training objective ofCLIMB-3D, incorporating ER, PLG, and THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D7

While CI-3DIS methods offer a wide range of practical applications, they frequently rely
on the assumption of uniform sample distribution, which rarely holds in real-world settings. In practice, the number of object categories, denoted byC, is often large and characterised
by substantial variability in category frequency, shape, structure, and size. To address these
challenges, we propose three incremental learning scenarios, each designed to capture a
different facet of real-world complexity. The design of these scenarios is detailed below; for
further information and illustrations, refer to Appendix E of the supplementary material. Split-A: Frequency Scenarios.This scenario acknowledges that datasets are often la-
belled based on the frequency of categories. To accommodate this, we propose a split where
the model learns from the most frequent categories and subsequently incorporates the less
frequent ones in later stages. By prioritising the training of frequently occurring categories,
the model can establish a strong foundation before expanding to handle rare categories. Split-B: Semantic Scenarios.Beyond frequency, semantic similarity is crucial in real-
world deployments. While objects often share visual or functional traits, models may en-
counter semantically different categories in new environments. To simulate this challenge,
we introduce theSplit-Bscenario. Here, categories are grouped based on their semantic
relationships, and the model is incrementally trained on one semantic group at a time. This
setup encourages the model to generalise across semantically similar categories and adapt
more effectively when exposed to new ones. Unlike theSplit-Ascenario, which organises
learning based on category frequency, theSplit-Bscenario may contain both frequent and
infrequent categories within a single task, focusing on semantic continuity and transfer. Split-C: Random Scenarios.In some cases, data labelling is driven by the availability of
objects rather than predefined criteria. To capture this, we introduce theSplit-Cscenario,
which represents a fully random setting where any class can appear in any task, resulting in
varying levels of class imbalance. By exposing the model to such diverse and unpredictable
distributions, we aim to improve its robustness in real-world situations where labelled data
availability is inconsistent. These incremental scenarios are designed to provide a more realistic representation of
object distributions, frequencies, and dynamics encountered in the real world. 4 Experiments

assessing real-world scenarios. In addition, we compare our approach against existing in-
cremental learning methods using ScanNetV2 [16] in the 3DSS setting. For this evaluation,
we follow the standard training and validation splits defined in prior works [74] to ensure
consistency with existing methods. Evaluation Metrics.We evaluate our method usingMean Average Precision(mAP), a
standard metric for 3DIS which provides a comprehensive measure of segmentation quality
by accounting for both precision and recall. For comparison with existing 3DSS methods,
we report themean Intersection over Union(mIoU), which quantifies the overlap between
predicted and ground truth segments. To assess the model’s ability to mitigate catastrophic
forgetting in incremental settings, we use theForgetting Percentage Points(FPP) metric, as
defined in [47]. FPP captures performance degradation by measuring the accuracy drop on
the initially seen categories between the first and final training phases. Detailed descriptions of the incremental scenarios (Split-A,Split-B,Split-C) and im-
plementation are provided in Appendix B. 4.2 Results and Discussion

To evaluate our proposed approach, we construct a baseline using ER [5] for the 3DIS
setting, as no existing incremental baselines are available for this task. In contrast, for the
3DSS setting, where incremental baselines do exist, we compare our method against three
prior approaches [43, 60, 74]. Results on CI-3DIS.Tab. 1 compares CLIMB-3D against the ER baseline across the three
CI-3DIS scenarios, evaluated after all phases using mAP 25, mAP50, overall mAP, and FPP. In theSplit-Ascenario, characterised by significant distribution shifts, our method achieves
gains of +19.23%, +16.76%, and +12.28% in mAP 25, mAP 50, and overall mAP, respec-
tively, while drastically reducing forgetting with FPP scores of 3.44% (mAP 25) and 2.63%
(mAP50), both over 45 points lower than the baseline. Under theSplit-Bscenario, with
semantically related new categories, improvements of +18.26%, +16.49%, and +12.76%
are observed alongside a reduction in forgetting to 8.00% and 5.51% from baseline levels
above 42%. For theSplit-Cscenario, featuring increasing geometric complexity, CLIMB-
3D maintains solid gains of +5.94%, +5.70%, and +4.08% across mAP metrics, with forget-
ting reduced by over 22 points. Overall, these results demonstrate robust forward transfer,
minimal forgetting, and stable learning, highlighting the method’s effectiveness for scalable
continual 3D semantic understanding. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D9

Results on CI-3DSS.Although our primary focus is on CI-3DIS, we also evaluate our
method under the CI-3DSS setting to enable comparisons with existing approaches. To do
so, we adapt our predictions to assign each point the label corresponding to the highest-
confidence mask and exclude background classes (e.g., floor and wall), as these are not part
of the semantic segmentation targets. Tab. 2 presents a comparison between our method and
existing baselines on the ScanNet V2 dataset [16], evaluated using mIoU across two training
phases and overall. Although originally designed for instance segmentation, our method
generalises effectively to semantic segmentation, achieving substantial gains of +35.23%
mIoU in Phase 1 and +19.1% in Phase 2. Overall, it achieves 59.38% mIoU, significantly
higher than the∼30% mIoU of prior methods, highlighting its robustness and transferability. Refer to Appendix C, D, and F of the supplementary material for detailed analyses of per-
phase performance, rare-class evaluation, and qualitative result comparisons, respectively. 4.3 Ablation

We conduct an ablation study to evaluate the contribution of each component in our
framework. As an upper bound, we report the performance of anOraclemodel, which is
trained jointly on the full dataset. For the incremental setting, we follow the previously
defined splits and first train the model naively across phases. We then incrementally add
each module to isolate its impact. Tab. 3 presents results for theSplit-Ascenario using both
mAP50 and FPP metrics. Naïve Training.When trained naïvely without any dedicated modules, the model suffers
from severe catastrophic forgetting, as evident in row 2. The model entirely forgets pre-
viously learned classes upon entering new phases, with performance dropping to zero for
earlier splits and FPP rising to 56.82. 10THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D
Effect of ER.Adding exemplar replay (row 3) partially alleviates forgetting by maintaining
a buffer of past examples. This yields notable gains fors1in Phase 2 (+18.51%) and Phase 3
(+10.38%), and also improvess2in Phase 3 (+9.43%). However, the overall forgetting
remains substantial (FPP: 46.44), showing ER alone is insufficient. Effect of PLG.The addition of the pseudo-label generator (PLG), which generates labels for
previous classes by retaining a copy of the model from an earlier phase, facilitates knowledge
retention and forward transfer. As shown in row 4, PLG significantly reduces forgetting and
enhances performance on current tasks. Fors1, it improves mAP 50 by 31.49% in Phase 2
and 39.40% in Phase 3 over exemplar replay. Overall, PLG yields a 15.00% increase in
performance and reduces forgetting by 39.40%. Effect of CBR.Finally, class-balanced re-weighting (CBR) mitigates class imbalance dur-
ing both pseudo-labelling and current task learning by adjusting each class’s contribution
based on its frequency. As shown in row 5, CBR enhancess1retention over PLG in Phases 2
and 3 (+4.67% and +4.41%), and further improves performance ons2ands3. It also achieves
the lowest FPP of 2.63, reflecting strong forgetting mitigation. Overall, CBR offers the best
trade-off between retaining past knowledge and acquiring new tasks, outperforming PLG
and ER by 4.41% and 43.81%, respectively. 4.4 Limitations & Future Work
While CLIMB-3D achieves strong performance across CI-3DIS and CI-3DSS settings, sev-
eral limitations remain and warrant discussion. The experiments are currently limited to
indoor datasets (ScanNet200 and ScanNetV2), therefore evaluating performance on outdoor
scenes would help assess generalisability across diverse environments. The current setup
also considers only three incremental phases, whereas real-world applications often involve
longer sequences; incorporating such extended setups would better reflect practical chal-
lenges. Moreover, the model operates in a uni-modal setting. Integrating multi-modal cues,
such as vision-language models, could further enhance performance, as suggested by recent
2D and 3D studies [25, 65, 66]. 5 Conclusion
This work addresses the challenge of catastrophic forgetting in class-incremental 3D in-
stance segmentation by introducing a modular framework that integrates exemplar replay
(ER), a pseudo-label generator (PLG), and class-balanced re-weighting (CBR). The pro-
posed method incrementally adapts to new classes while preserving prior knowledge, all
without requiring access to the full dataset. Extensive experiments on a three-phase bench-
mark validate the individual and combined effectiveness of each component: ER enables
efficient memory-based retention; PLG facilitates knowledge preservation through pseudo-
supervision; and CBR mitigates class imbalance to enhance learning stability. Together,
these components significantly reduce forgetting and improve segmentation performance
across all phases. By achieving a strong balance between stability and plasticity, our ap-
proach advances continual 3D scene understanding and sets a new baseline for future re-
search in this area. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D11

What are the three incremental learning scenarios proposed for CI-3DIS in the document?,"To address these challenges, we propose three incremental learning scenarios, each designed to capture a different facet of real-world complexity. The design of these scenarios is detailed below; for further information and illustrations, refer to Appendix E of the supplementary material. Split-A: Frequency Scenarios. This scenario acknowledges that datasets are often labelled based on the frequency of categories. To accommodate this, we propose a split where the model learns from the most frequent categories and subsequently incorporates the less frequent ones in later stages. By prioritising the training of frequently occurring categories, the model can establish a strong foundation before expanding to handle rare categories. Split-B: Semantic Scenarios. Beyond frequency, semantic similarity is crucial in real-world deployments. While objects often share visual or functional traits, models may encounter semantically different categories in new environments. To simulate this challenge, we introduce the Split-B scenario. Here, categories are grouped based on their semantic relationships, and the model is incrementally trained on one semantic group at a time. This setup encourages the model to generalise across semantically similar categories and adapt more effectively when exposed to new ones. Unlike the Split-A scenario, which organises learning based on category frequency, the Split-B scenario may contain both frequent and infrequent categories within a single task, focusing on semantic continuity and transfer. Split-C: Random Scenarios. In some cases, data labelling is driven by the availability of objects rather than predefined criteria. To capture this, we introduce the Split-C scenario, which represents a fully random setting where any class can appear in any task, resulting in varying levels of class imbalance. By exposing the model to such diverse and unpredictable distributions, we aim to improve its robustness in real-world situations where labelled data availability is inconsistent.","To address these challenges, we propose three incremental learning scenarios, each designed to capture a different facet of real-world complexity.

5 and Tab. 6, correspond to evaluations onSplit-AforPhase
2andPhase 3, respectively. InPhase 2, we evaluate classes seen 1–20 times per epoch,
whilePhase 3targets even less frequent classes, with observations limited to 1–10 times per
epoch. As illustrated in Tab. 5, the IC module substantially improves performance on rare
classes in terms of mAP 50 in Phase 2 ofSplit-A. For instance, classes likerecycling
binandtrash bin, seen only 3 and 7 times, respectively, shows significant improvement
when the IC module is applied. Overall, the IC module provides an average boost of 8.32%,
highlighting its effectiveness in mitigating class imbalance. Similarly, Tab. 6 presents results forPhase 3, demonstrating significant gains for infre-
quent classes. For example, even though the classes such aspiano,bucket, andlaundry
basketare observed only once, IC module improves the performance by 52.30%, 10.40%,

ance by focusing on underrepresented categories. On average, the addition of the proposed THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D3

baseline method. Fig. 4 illustrates the results on theSplit-Aevaluation after learning all
tasks, comparing the performance of the baseline method and our proposed approach. As
shown in the figure, our method demonstrates superior instance segmentation performance
compared to the baseline. For example, in row 1, the baseline method fails to segment

Abstract
While 3D instance segmentation (3DIS) has advanced significantly, most existing
methods assume that all object classes are known in advance and uniformly distributed. However, this assumption is unrealistic in dynamic, real-world environments where new
classes emerge gradually and exhibit natural imbalance. Although some approaches ad-
dress the emergence of new classes, they often overlook class imbalance, which leads
to suboptimal performance, particularly on rare categories. To tackle this, we propose
CLIMB-3D, a unified framework forCLass-incrementalImbalance-aware3DIS. Build-
ing upon established exemplar replay (ER) strategies, we show that ER alone is insuf-
ficient to achieve robust performance under memory constraints. To mitigate this, we
introduce a novel pseudo-label generator (PLG) that extends supervision to previously
learned categories by leveraging predictions from a frozen model trained on prior tasks. Despite its promise, PLG tends to be biased towards frequent classes. Therefore, we
propose a class-balanced re-weighting (CBR) scheme that estimates object frequencies
from pseudo-labels and dynamically adjusts training bias, without requiring access to
past data. We design and evaluate three incremental scenarios for 3DIS on the challeng-
ing ScanNet200 dataset and additionally validate our method for semantic segmentation
on ScanNetV2. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing prior work by
up to 16.76% mAP for instance segmentation and approximately 30% mIoU for semantic
segmentation, demonstrating strong generalisation across both frequent and rare classes. Code is available at:https://github.com/vgthengane/CLIMB3D. © 2025.

whilePhase 3targets even less frequent classes, with observations limited to 1–10 times per
epoch. As illustrated in Tab. 5, the IC module substantially improves performance on rare
classes in terms of mAP 50 in Phase 2 ofSplit-A. For instance, classes likerecycling

when the IC module is applied. Overall, the IC module provides an average boost of 8.32%,

1 Introduction
Table Chair Couch Pillow Coffee Table Sofa Chair Recycling BinCabinet Unknown
Task-1 Task-2 Task-3
Figure 1:Overview of the CI-3DIS setting.New object categories are introduced incre-
mentally with each task. After every phase, the model must recognise both newly added
and previously learned classes. For instance, in Task 2, categories such asPillow,Coffee
Table, andSofa Chairare introduced, while the model is expected to retain recognition
of earlier classes likeTable,Chair, andCouch. 3D instance segmentation (3DIS) is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves
identifying precise object boundaries and class labels in 3D space, with broad applications in
graphics, robotics, and augmented reality [4, 39]. Traditional 3DIS methods, including top-
down [28, 70, 78], bottom-up [26, 73], and transformer-based approaches [59], perform well
under the assumption that all classes are available and balanced during training. However,
this assumption does not hold in real-world environments, where new object classes emerge
over time and exhibit natural imbalance. This gap motivates the need for Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) [17, 54], which sup-
ports learning new categories while retaining knowledge of previous ones [51]. While CIL
has seen success in 2D image tasks [1, 43, 54, 60], extensions to 3D point clouds remain
limited, often focusing on object-level classification [13, 18, 48]. Recent works on scene-
level class-incremental 3DIS (CI-3DIS) [4] and class-incremental semantic segmentation
(CI-3DSS) [74] show promise, but depend heavily on large exemplar [56] and overlook class
imbalance, limiting their practicality. To address this, we proposeCLIMB-3D, a unified framework forCLass-incremental
IMBalance-aware3DIS that jointly tackles catastrophic forgetting and class imbalance. The
framework begins with Exemplar Replay (ER), storing a small number of samples from
past classes for later replay. However, this alone does not yield promising results under the
strict memory constraints required in CI-3DIS. To address this, we introduce a Pseudo-Label
Generator (PLG), which uses a frozen model from previous task to generate supervision for
earlier classes. However, we observed that PLG tends to favour frequent classes while ig-
noring under-represented ones. To mitigate this, we propose a Class-Balanced Re-weighting
(CBR), which estimates class frequencies from the pseudo-labels to enhance the learning of
rare classes without accessing past data. Together, these components form a practical and
effective solution for real-world 3DIS. To evaluate CLIMB-3D, we designed three benchmark scenarios for CI-3DIS based on
the ScanNet200 dataset [57]. These scenarios simulate incremental learning setup under nat-
ural class imbalance, where new classes emerge based on (A) object frequency, (B) semantic
similarity, or (C) random grouping. Additionally, for comparison with existing methods,
we evaluate our approach on CI-3DSS using the ScanNetV2 dataset [16]. Experimental re-
sults show that our method significantly reduces forgetting and improves performance across
both frequent and rare categories, outperforming previous methods in both settings. Fig. 1
illustrates the CI-3DIS setup. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D3
In summary, our contributions are: (i) a novel problem setting of imbalanced class-
incremental 3DIS with an effective method to balance learning and mitigate forgetting; (ii)

3D Instance Segmentation.Various methods have been proposed for 3DIS. Grouping-
based approaches adopt a bottom-up pipeline that learns latent embeddings for point cluster-
ing [9, 21, 22, 29, 37, 44, 70, 78]. In contrast, proposal-based methods follow a top-down
strategy by detecting 3D boxes and segmenting objects within them [19, 26, 46, 73, 76]. Recently, transformer-based models [68] have also been applied to 3DIS and 3DSS [59, 64],
inspired by advances in 2D vision [10, 11]. However, these approaches require full anno-
tations for all classes and are not designed for progressive learning, where only new class
annotations are available and previous data is inaccessible. Another line of work aims to re-
duce annotation costs by proposing weakly supervised 3DIS methods based on sparse cues
[12, 27, 72]. While effective with limited annotations, these methods assume a fixed set of
classes and are susceptible to catastrophic forgetting in incremental settings. Incremental Learning.Continual learning involves training models sequentially to miti-
gate catastrophic forgetting. One common strategy is model regularisation, which constrains
parameter updates using techniques such as elastic weight consolidation or knowledge dis-
tillation [1, 24, 35, 43, 60]. Another approach is exemplar replay, where past data is stored
or generated to rehearse older tasks while learning new ones [5, 7, 30, 54]. A third direc-
tion involves dynamically expanding the model architecture or using modular sub-networks
to accommodate new tasks without interfering with old ones [31, 42, 53, 58, 71, 79]. Re-
cent efforts in class-incremental 3D segmentation [63, 74] have shown early promise but
often rely on basic architectures and focus primarily on semantic segmentation. Other works
[4, 36] explore continual learning in 3D settings, though they often depend on large memory
buffers. In contrast, our work introduces a tailored framework for 3D instance segmentation
that effectively transfers knowledge across tasks, even under class imbalance. Long-tailed Recognition.Imbalanced class distributions lead to poor recognition of rare
(long-tail) classes. To address this, re-sampling methods balance the data via input [8, 20, 50,
52, 61] or feature space [3, 14, 40], avoiding naïve under-/over-sampling. Loss re-weighting
offers another direction, using class-based [6, 15, 23, 32, 33, 69] or per-example [45, 55, 62]
adjustments to ensure fair contribution. Parameter regularisation improves generalisation
through weight constraints [2], albeit requiring careful tuning. Other approaches leverage
transfer learning [77, 81], self-supervision [41, 75], or contrastive learning [34, 41, 82] to
improve rare-class representations. Long-tailed recognition is well-studied in 2D with large-
scale datasets [15, 49, 67]; in 3D, ScanNet200 [16, 57] enables similar efforts. Prior 3D
work focused on re-weighting, re-sampling, and transfer learning [57], while regularisation
remains underexplored. CeCo [80] balances class centres via auxiliary loss but overlooks
sampling and augmentation. Lahoud et al. [38] propose adaptive classifier regularisation
for 3D segmentation, outperforming prior approaches without threshold tuning. However,
neither method considers incremental learning. In contrast, we jointly address long-tail and
continual 3D semantic segmentation. 4THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D

Figure 2: Overview ofCLIMB-3Dfor CI-3DIS. The model incrementally learns new classes
across sequential phases. During taskt, point cloudsPand their corresponding labelsY t are
sampled from a combination of the current training datasetD t and Exemplar Replay (ER),
which maintains a small memory of past examples. These are then passed to the current
modelΦ t to produce predicted labelsY t . The Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG) selects the
top-Kpredictions from the previous modelΦ t−1 . These pseudo-labels are then weighted
based on class frequencyf(c)using Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR), and the top-Kre-
weighted labels are selected to form the balanced pseudo-label set ¯Yt . This pseudo-label set
is then concatenated with the ground-truth labels to form a final augmented supervision set
Yt for taskt, which is used to optimise the modelΦ t using Eq. (3). 3 Methodology
3.1 Problem Formulation
3DIS.The objective of this task is to detect and segment each object instance within a point
cloud. Formally, the training dataset is denoted asD={(P i,Yi)}N
i=1, whereNis the number
of training samples. Each inputP i ∈R M×6 is a coloured point cloud consisting ofMpoints,
where each point is represented by its 3D coordinates and RGB values. The corresponding
annotationY i ={(m i,j ,ci,j )}Ji
j=1 containsJ i object instances, wheremi,j ∈ {0,1}M is a binary
mask indicating which points belong to thej-th instance, andc i,j ∈ C={1,...,C}is the
semantic class label of that instance. GivenP i, the modelΦpredicts instance-level outputs
ˆYi ={(ˆmi,j ,ˆci,j )}
ˆJi
j=1, where ˆmi,j and ˆci,j denote the predicted mask and category label for
thej-th instance, respectively. The number of predicted instances ˆJi varies depending on the
model’s inference. The model is optimised using the following objective:
L3DIS(D;Φ) = 1

(P,Y)∈D

(mj,cj)∈Y
(Lmask(mj,ˆmj)+λ·L cls(cj,ˆcj)),(1)
whereL cls andL mask are the average classification and mask losses over all instances, andλ
controls their trade-off. CI-3DIS.Unlike conventional 3DIS, CI-3DIS involves sequential learning, where object
categories are introduced incrementally overTtraining tasks. Each tasktintroduces a dis-
joint set of classesC t , withC= ST

encountered in previous tasks, despite limited supervision and the absence of past labels. 3.2 Method: CLIMB-3D
Overview.As shown in Fig. 2 and formulated in Sec. 3.1, the proposed framework for
CI-3DIS follows aphase-wisetraining strategy. In each phase, the model is exposed to a
carefully curated subset of the dataset, simulating real-world scenarios discussed in Sec. 3.3. Training naïvely on such phased data leads tocatastrophic forgetting[51], where the model
forgets prior knowledge when learning new tasks. To address this, we first incorporateEx-
emplar Replay(ER) [5], a strategy inspired by 2D incremental methods [1, 43, 54] and
recently extended to 3D settings [4], to mitigate forgetting by storing a small set of repre-
sentative samples from earlier phases. However, ER alone is insufficient to achieve robust
performance. To address this, two additional components are introduced: aPseudo-Label
Generator(PLG), which leverages a frozen model to generate supervision signals for previ-
ously seen classes, and aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) module that compensates for
class imbalance across phases. Each of these components is described in detail below 1. Exemplar Replay (ER).Inspired by Buzzega et al. [5], ER addresses the issue of catas-
trophic forgetting by allowing the model to retain a subset of data from earlier phases. During phaset, the model is trained not only on the current task dataD t , but also on a
set of exemplarsE 1:t−1, collected from previous phases. These exemplars are accumulated
incrementally:E 1:t−1 =E 1 ∪···∪E t−1 .Here,E t denotes the exemplar subset stored after
phaset, and|E t |denotes the exemplar replay size. The combined replay dataset is denoted
as:D t
ER =D t ∪E 1:t−1.Epoch training consists of two stages: first, the model is trained on
the current data,D t ; then it is trained using exemplars fromE 1:t−1. While previous CI-3DIS approaches rely on large exemplar sets to mitigate forgetting [4],
such strategies become impractical under memory constraints. Consequently, although ER
aids knowledge retention, it is insufficient on its own for robust performance with a limited
exemplar budget. Therefore, PLG and CBR are introduced to better preserve past represen-
tations and enhance generalisation across phases. Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG).In the CI-3DIS setting, during phaset(wheret>1),
although ground-truth labels for previously seen classes are unavailable, the model from the
previous phaseΦ t−1 , which preserves knowledge of past tasks, is retained. We use this
model to generate pseudo-labels for previously seen classes, thereby providing approximate
supervision during training. This allows the current modelΦt , to retain prior knowledge and
reduce forgetting, even without access to ground-truth annotations. Given a point cloud and label pair(P,Y t ), fromD t , the previous modelΦ t−1 , generates
pseudo-labels for the previously seen classes as ˆY1:t−1 =Φ t−1 (P), which we denote as ˜Yt
1For clarity, modifications introduced by each component (ER, PLG, and CBR) are highlighted in green, blue,
and red, respectively. 6THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D
for brevity. However, we observe that utilising all predictions fromΦt−1 introduces noisy or
incorrect labels, which degrade overall performance. To mitigate this, we select the top-K
most confident instance predictions, denoted as ˜Yt
K, and concatenate them with the ground-
truth labels of the current task to obtain the supervision set: ¯Yt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt
K. Following this,
the loss is computed over both the current task’s ground-truth labels and the top-Kconfi-
dent pseudo-labels from earlier phases, enabling the model to retain prior knowledge while
adapting to new classes. Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR).While ER and PLG contribute to preserving prior
knowledge, we observe that the model’s predictions are biased towards frequent classes,
resulting in the forgetting of rare categories. This issue is further amplified by the top-K
pseudo-labels selected by PLG, which predominantly represent dominant classes in the data. To address this, we propose aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) scheme that compensates
for class imbalance using object frequency statistics. At taskt, only the current datasetD t
and its label distributionp t (c)over classesc∈ Ct are available. Datasets and class distribu-
tions from earlier tasks{D i,p i(c)}t−1
i=1 are no longer accessible, which makes it challenging
to directly account for class imbalance across all previously seen tasks. Therefore, we pro-
pose to leverage the pseudo-label predictions of the frozen modelΦ t−1 as a proxy for the
class distribution across previously learned categories. During each training iteration, the previous modelΦ t−1 is applied to the current inputP
to generate pseudo-labels ˜Yt , from which we accumulate class-wise frequency statistics for
previously learned classes. LetC1:t = St
i=1 Ci represent the union of all classes seen up to task
t. At the end of each epoch, we compute the overall class frequencyf∈R |C1:t | by combining
the pseudo-label distribution ˜pt (c)derived from ˜Yt with the ground-truth label distribution
pt (c)from the current task. The resulting frequency vectorf= [f(c)] c∈C1:t is then used to
compute class-wise weightsw= [w(c)] c∈C1:t , which guide balanced pseudo-label selection
and help the model focus on rare classes. In the next epoch, the modelΦ t−1 produces soft pseudo-label predictions ˜Yt (as de-
scribed in PLG) , where each component ˜Yt [c]denotes the confidence score for classc∈
C1:t−1. To promote balanced pseudo-label selection, class-wise re-weighting is applied using
w(c) = 1
f(c)+ε , whereεis a small constant for numerical stability. The adjusted predictions
are computed by applying the class-wise weights as: ˜Yt,w [c] =w(c)· ˜Yt [c],∀c∈ C 1:t−1. Top-Kselection is then applied to both the original and the re-weighted scores, yielding
two pseudo-label sets: ˜Yt
K and ˜Yt,w
K , respectively. The final augmented target set, Yt , is
constructed by concatenating the ground-truth labelsY t with both sets of pseudo-labels:
Yt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt
K ∥ ˜Yt,w
K .(2)
Although the above re-weighting mitigates bias from prior tasks, it does not address class
imbalance within the current taskt. To resolve this, the class-balanced weightsw c are ex-
tended to incorporate statistics from both previously seen and current classes, i.e., overC 1:t
rather than onlyC 1:t−1. The updated weights, denoted asw ′
c, are used to re-weights both
pseudo-label selection and classification loss, ensuring balanced supervision across all seen
categories, including rare ones. This unified strategy reduces bias and enhances performance
across phases. The pseudo-code for constructing the supervision set in Eq. (2), which incor-
porates both PLG and CBR components, is provided in Appendix A. Final Objective.The final training objective ofCLIMB-3D, incorporating ER, PLG, and THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D7

While CI-3DIS methods offer a wide range of practical applications, they frequently rely
on the assumption of uniform sample distribution, which rarely holds in real-world settings. In practice, the number of object categories, denoted byC, is often large and characterised
by substantial variability in category frequency, shape, structure, and size. To address these
challenges, we propose three incremental learning scenarios, each designed to capture a
different facet of real-world complexity. The design of these scenarios is detailed below; for
further information and illustrations, refer to Appendix E of the supplementary material. Split-A: Frequency Scenarios.This scenario acknowledges that datasets are often la-
belled based on the frequency of categories. To accommodate this, we propose a split where
the model learns from the most frequent categories and subsequently incorporates the less
frequent ones in later stages. By prioritising the training of frequently occurring categories,
the model can establish a strong foundation before expanding to handle rare categories. Split-B: Semantic Scenarios.Beyond frequency, semantic similarity is crucial in real-
world deployments. While objects often share visual or functional traits, models may en-
counter semantically different categories in new environments. To simulate this challenge,
we introduce theSplit-Bscenario. Here, categories are grouped based on their semantic
relationships, and the model is incrementally trained on one semantic group at a time. This
setup encourages the model to generalise across semantically similar categories and adapt
more effectively when exposed to new ones. Unlike theSplit-Ascenario, which organises
learning based on category frequency, theSplit-Bscenario may contain both frequent and
infrequent categories within a single task, focusing on semantic continuity and transfer. Split-C: Random Scenarios.In some cases, data labelling is driven by the availability of
objects rather than predefined criteria. To capture this, we introduce theSplit-Cscenario,
which represents a fully random setting where any class can appear in any task, resulting in
varying levels of class imbalance. By exposing the model to such diverse and unpredictable
distributions, we aim to improve its robustness in real-world situations where labelled data
availability is inconsistent. These incremental scenarios are designed to provide a more realistic representation of
object distributions, frequencies, and dynamics encountered in the real world. 4 Experiments

assessing real-world scenarios. In addition, we compare our approach against existing in-
cremental learning methods using ScanNetV2 [16] in the 3DSS setting. For this evaluation,
we follow the standard training and validation splits defined in prior works [74] to ensure
consistency with existing methods. Evaluation Metrics.We evaluate our method usingMean Average Precision(mAP), a
standard metric for 3DIS which provides a comprehensive measure of segmentation quality
by accounting for both precision and recall. For comparison with existing 3DSS methods,
we report themean Intersection over Union(mIoU), which quantifies the overlap between
predicted and ground truth segments. To assess the model’s ability to mitigate catastrophic
forgetting in incremental settings, we use theForgetting Percentage Points(FPP) metric, as
defined in [47]. FPP captures performance degradation by measuring the accuracy drop on
the initially seen categories between the first and final training phases. Detailed descriptions of the incremental scenarios (Split-A,Split-B,Split-C) and im-
plementation are provided in Appendix B. 4.2 Results and Discussion

To evaluate our proposed approach, we construct a baseline using ER [5] for the 3DIS
setting, as no existing incremental baselines are available for this task. In contrast, for the
3DSS setting, where incremental baselines do exist, we compare our method against three
prior approaches [43, 60, 74]. Results on CI-3DIS.Tab. 1 compares CLIMB-3D against the ER baseline across the three
CI-3DIS scenarios, evaluated after all phases using mAP 25, mAP50, overall mAP, and FPP. In theSplit-Ascenario, characterised by significant distribution shifts, our method achieves
gains of +19.23%, +16.76%, and +12.28% in mAP 25, mAP 50, and overall mAP, respec-
tively, while drastically reducing forgetting with FPP scores of 3.44% (mAP 25) and 2.63%
(mAP50), both over 45 points lower than the baseline. Under theSplit-Bscenario, with
semantically related new categories, improvements of +18.26%, +16.49%, and +12.76%
are observed alongside a reduction in forgetting to 8.00% and 5.51% from baseline levels
above 42%. For theSplit-Cscenario, featuring increasing geometric complexity, CLIMB-
3D maintains solid gains of +5.94%, +5.70%, and +4.08% across mAP metrics, with forget-
ting reduced by over 22 points. Overall, these results demonstrate robust forward transfer,
minimal forgetting, and stable learning, highlighting the method’s effectiveness for scalable
continual 3D semantic understanding. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D9

Results on CI-3DSS.Although our primary focus is on CI-3DIS, we also evaluate our
method under the CI-3DSS setting to enable comparisons with existing approaches. To do
so, we adapt our predictions to assign each point the label corresponding to the highest-
confidence mask and exclude background classes (e.g., floor and wall), as these are not part
of the semantic segmentation targets. Tab. 2 presents a comparison between our method and
existing baselines on the ScanNet V2 dataset [16], evaluated using mIoU across two training
phases and overall. Although originally designed for instance segmentation, our method
generalises effectively to semantic segmentation, achieving substantial gains of +35.23%
mIoU in Phase 1 and +19.1% in Phase 2. Overall, it achieves 59.38% mIoU, significantly
higher than the∼30% mIoU of prior methods, highlighting its robustness and transferability. Refer to Appendix C, D, and F of the supplementary material for detailed analyses of per-
phase performance, rare-class evaluation, and qualitative result comparisons, respectively. 4.3 Ablation

We conduct an ablation study to evaluate the contribution of each component in our
framework. As an upper bound, we report the performance of anOraclemodel, which is
trained jointly on the full dataset. For the incremental setting, we follow the previously
defined splits and first train the model naively across phases. We then incrementally add
each module to isolate its impact. Tab. 3 presents results for theSplit-Ascenario using both
mAP50 and FPP metrics. Naïve Training.When trained naïvely without any dedicated modules, the model suffers
from severe catastrophic forgetting, as evident in row 2. The model entirely forgets pre-
viously learned classes upon entering new phases, with performance dropping to zero for
earlier splits and FPP rising to 56.82. 10THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D
Effect of ER.Adding exemplar replay (row 3) partially alleviates forgetting by maintaining
a buffer of past examples. This yields notable gains fors1in Phase 2 (+18.51%) and Phase 3
(+10.38%), and also improvess2in Phase 3 (+9.43%). However, the overall forgetting
remains substantial (FPP: 46.44), showing ER alone is insufficient. Effect of PLG.The addition of the pseudo-label generator (PLG), which generates labels for
previous classes by retaining a copy of the model from an earlier phase, facilitates knowledge
retention and forward transfer. As shown in row 4, PLG significantly reduces forgetting and
enhances performance on current tasks. Fors1, it improves mAP 50 by 31.49% in Phase 2
and 39.40% in Phase 3 over exemplar replay. Overall, PLG yields a 15.00% increase in
performance and reduces forgetting by 39.40%. Effect of CBR.Finally, class-balanced re-weighting (CBR) mitigates class imbalance dur-
ing both pseudo-labelling and current task learning by adjusting each class’s contribution
based on its frequency. As shown in row 5, CBR enhancess1retention over PLG in Phases 2
and 3 (+4.67% and +4.41%), and further improves performance ons2ands3. It also achieves
the lowest FPP of 2.63, reflecting strong forgetting mitigation. Overall, CBR offers the best
trade-off between retaining past knowledge and acquiring new tasks, outperforming PLG
and ER by 4.41% and 43.81%, respectively. 4.4 Limitations & Future Work
While CLIMB-3D achieves strong performance across CI-3DIS and CI-3DSS settings, sev-
eral limitations remain and warrant discussion. The experiments are currently limited to
indoor datasets (ScanNet200 and ScanNetV2), therefore evaluating performance on outdoor
scenes would help assess generalisability across diverse environments. The current setup
also considers only three incremental phases, whereas real-world applications often involve
longer sequences; incorporating such extended setups would better reflect practical chal-
lenges. Moreover, the model operates in a uni-modal setting. Integrating multi-modal cues,
such as vision-language models, could further enhance performance, as suggested by recent
2D and 3D studies [25, 65, 66]. 5 Conclusion
This work addresses the challenge of catastrophic forgetting in class-incremental 3D in-
stance segmentation by introducing a modular framework that integrates exemplar replay
(ER), a pseudo-label generator (PLG), and class-balanced re-weighting (CBR). The pro-
posed method incrementally adapts to new classes while preserving prior knowledge, all
without requiring access to the full dataset. Extensive experiments on a three-phase bench-
mark validate the individual and combined effectiveness of each component: ER enables
efficient memory-based retention; PLG facilitates knowledge preservation through pseudo-
supervision; and CBR mitigates class imbalance to enhance learning stability. Together,
these components significantly reduce forgetting and improve segmentation performance
across all phases. By achieving a strong balance between stability and plasticity, our ap-
proach advances continual 3D scene understanding and sets a new baseline for future re-
search in this area. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D11

1 Introduction
Table Chair Couch Pillow Coffee Table Sofa Chair Recycling BinCabinet Unknown
Task-1 Task-2 Task-3
Figure 1:Overview of the CI-3DIS setting.New object categories are introduced incre-
mentally with each task. After every phase, the model must recognise both newly added
and previously learned classes. For instance, in Task 2, categories such asPillow,Coffee
Table, andSofa Chairare introduced, while the model is expected to retain recognition
of earlier classes likeTable,Chair, andCouch. 3D instance segmentation (3DIS) is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves
identifying precise object boundaries and class labels in 3D space, with broad applications in
graphics, robotics, and augmented reality [4, 39]. Traditional 3DIS methods, including top-
down [28, 70, 78], bottom-up [26, 73], and transformer-based approaches [59], perform well
under the assumption that all classes are available and balanced during training. However,
this assumption does not hold in real-world environments, where new object classes emerge
over time and exhibit natural imbalance. This gap motivates the need for Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) [17, 54], which sup-
ports learning new categories while retaining knowledge of previous ones [51]. While CIL
has seen success in 2D image tasks [1, 43, 54, 60], extensions to 3D point clouds remain
limited, often focusing on object-level classification [13, 18, 48]. Recent works on scene-
level class-incremental 3DIS (CI-3DIS) [4] and class-incremental semantic segmentation
(CI-3DSS) [74] show promise, but depend heavily on large exemplar [56] and overlook class
imbalance, limiting their practicality. To address this, we proposeCLIMB-3D, a unified framework forCLass-incremental
IMBalance-aware3DIS that jointly tackles catastrophic forgetting and class imbalance. The
framework begins with Exemplar Replay (ER), storing a small number of samples from
past classes for later replay. However, this alone does not yield promising results under the
strict memory constraints required in CI-3DIS. To address this, we introduce a Pseudo-Label
Generator (PLG), which uses a frozen model from previous task to generate supervision for
earlier classes. However, we observed that PLG tends to favour frequent classes while ig-
noring under-represented ones. To mitigate this, we propose a Class-Balanced Re-weighting
(CBR), which estimates class frequencies from the pseudo-labels to enhance the learning of
rare classes without accessing past data. Together, these components form a practical and
effective solution for real-world 3DIS. To evaluate CLIMB-3D, we designed three benchmark scenarios for CI-3DIS based on
the ScanNet200 dataset [57]. These scenarios simulate incremental learning setup under nat-
ural class imbalance, where new classes emerge based on (A) object frequency, (B) semantic
similarity, or (C) random grouping. Additionally, for comparison with existing methods,
we evaluate our approach on CI-3DSS using the ScanNetV2 dataset [16]. Experimental re-
sults show that our method significantly reduces forgetting and improves performance across
both frequent and rare categories, outperforming previous methods in both settings. Fig. 1
illustrates the CI-3DIS setup. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D3
In summary, our contributions are: (i) a novel problem setting of imbalanced class-
incremental 3DIS with an effective method to balance learning and mitigate forgetting; (ii)
three benchmarks modelling continual object emergence with natural imbalance; and (iii)
strong experimental results, achieving up to 16.76% mAP improvement over baselines. 2 Related Work
3D Instance Segmentation.Various methods have been proposed for 3DIS. Grouping-
based approaches adopt a bottom-up pipeline that learns latent embeddings for point cluster-
ing [9, 21, 22, 29, 37, 44, 70, 78]. In contrast, proposal-based methods follow a top-down
strategy by detecting 3D boxes and segmenting objects within them [19, 26, 46, 73, 76]. Recently, transformer-based models [68] have also been applied to 3DIS and 3DSS [59, 64],
inspired by advances in 2D vision [10, 11]. However, these approaches require full anno-
tations for all classes and are not designed for progressive learning, where only new class
annotations are available and previous data is inaccessible. Another line of work aims to re-
duce annotation costs by proposing weakly supervised 3DIS methods based on sparse cues
[12, 27, 72]. While effective with limited annotations, these methods assume a fixed set of
classes and are susceptible to catastrophic forgetting in incremental settings. Incremental Learning.Continual learning involves training models sequentially to miti-
gate catastrophic forgetting. One common strategy is model regularisation, which constrains
parameter updates using techniques such as elastic weight consolidation or knowledge dis-
tillation [1, 24, 35, 43, 60]. Another approach is exemplar replay, where past data is stored
or generated to rehearse older tasks while learning new ones [5, 7, 30, 54]. A third direc-
tion involves dynamically expanding the model architecture or using modular sub-networks
to accommodate new tasks without interfering with old ones [31, 42, 53, 58, 71, 79]. Re-
cent efforts in class-incremental 3D segmentation [63, 74] have shown early promise but
often rely on basic architectures and focus primarily on semantic segmentation. Other works
[4, 36] explore continual learning in 3D settings, though they often depend on large memory
buffers. In contrast, our work introduces a tailored framework for 3D instance segmentation
that effectively transfers knowledge across tasks, even under class imbalance. Long-tailed Recognition.Imbalanced class distributions lead to poor recognition of rare
(long-tail) classes. To address this, re-sampling methods balance the data via input [8, 20, 50,
52, 61] or feature space [3, 14, 40], avoiding naïve under-/over-sampling. Loss re-weighting
offers another direction, using class-based [6, 15, 23, 32, 33, 69] or per-example [45, 55, 62]
adjustments to ensure fair contribution. Parameter regularisation improves generalisation
through weight constraints [2], albeit requiring careful tuning. Other approaches leverage
transfer learning [77, 81], self-supervision [41, 75], or contrastive learning [34, 41, 82] to
improve rare-class representations. Long-tailed recognition is well-studied in 2D with large-
scale datasets [15, 49, 67]; in 3D, ScanNet200 [16, 57] enables similar efforts. Prior 3D
work focused on re-weighting, re-sampling, and transfer learning [57], while regularisation
remains underexplored. CeCo [80] balances class centres via auxiliary loss but overlooks
sampling and augmentation. Lahoud et al. [38] propose adaptive classifier regularisation
for 3D segmentation, outperforming prior approaches without threshold tuning. However,
neither method considers incremental learning. In contrast, we jointly address long-tail and
continual 3D semantic segmentation. 4THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D

Figure 2: Overview ofCLIMB-3Dfor CI-3DIS. The model incrementally learns new classes
across sequential phases. During taskt, point cloudsPand their corresponding labelsY t are
sampled from a combination of the current training datasetD t and Exemplar Replay (ER),
which maintains a small memory of past examples. These are then passed to the current
modelΦ t to produce predicted labelsY t . The Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG) selects the
top-Kpredictions from the previous modelΦ t−1 . These pseudo-labels are then weighted
based on class frequencyf(c)using Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR), and the top-Kre-
weighted labels are selected to form the balanced pseudo-label set ¯Yt . This pseudo-label set
is then concatenated with the ground-truth labels to form a final augmented supervision set
Yt for taskt, which is used to optimise the modelΦ t using Eq. (3). 3 Methodology
3.1 Problem Formulation
3DIS.The objective of this task is to detect and segment each object instance within a point
cloud. Formally, the training dataset is denoted asD={(P i,Yi)}N
i=1, whereNis the number
of training samples. Each inputP i ∈R M×6 is a coloured point cloud consisting ofMpoints,
where each point is represented by its 3D coordinates and RGB values. The corresponding
annotationY i ={(m i,j ,ci,j )}Ji
j=1 containsJ i object instances, wheremi,j ∈ {0,1}M is a binary
mask indicating which points belong to thej-th instance, andc i,j ∈ C={1,...,C}is the
semantic class label of that instance. GivenP i, the modelΦpredicts instance-level outputs
ˆYi ={(ˆmi,j ,ˆci,j )}
ˆJi
j=1, where ˆmi,j and ˆci,j denote the predicted mask and category label for
thej-th instance, respectively. The number of predicted instances ˆJi varies depending on the
model’s inference. The model is optimised using the following objective:
L3DIS(D;Φ) = 1

(P,Y)∈D

|Y| ∑
(mj,cj)∈Y
(Lmask(mj,ˆmj)+λ·L cls(cj,ˆcj)),(1)
whereL cls andL mask are the average classification and mask losses over all instances, andλ
controls their trade-off. CI-3DIS.Unlike conventional 3DIS, CI-3DIS involves sequential learning, where object
categories are introduced incrementally overTtraining tasks. Each tasktintroduces a dis-
joint set of classesC t , withC= ST

Overview.As shown in Fig. 2 and formulated in Sec. 3.1, the proposed framework for
CI-3DIS follows aphase-wisetraining strategy. In each phase, the model is exposed to a
carefully curated subset of the dataset, simulating real-world scenarios discussed in Sec. 3.3. Training naïvely on such phased data leads tocatastrophic forgetting[51], where the model
forgets prior knowledge when learning new tasks. To address this, we first incorporateEx-
emplar Replay(ER) [5], a strategy inspired by 2D incremental methods [1, 43, 54] and
recently extended to 3D settings [4], to mitigate forgetting by storing a small set of repre-
sentative samples from earlier phases. However, ER alone is insufficient to achieve robust
performance. To address this, two additional components are introduced: aPseudo-Label
Generator(PLG), which leverages a frozen model to generate supervision signals for previ-
ously seen classes, and aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) module that compensates for
class imbalance across phases. Each of these components is described in detail below 1. Exemplar Replay (ER).Inspired by Buzzega et al. [5], ER addresses the issue of catas-
trophic forgetting by allowing the model to retain a subset of data from earlier phases. During phaset, the model is trained not only on the current task dataD t , but also on a
set of exemplarsE 1:t−1, collected from previous phases. These exemplars are accumulated
incrementally:E 1:t−1 =E 1 ∪···∪E t−1 .Here,E t denotes the exemplar subset stored after
phaset, and|E t |denotes the exemplar replay size. The combined replay dataset is denoted
as:D t
ER =D t ∪E 1:t−1.Epoch training consists of two stages: first, the model is trained on
the current data,D t ; then it is trained using exemplars fromE 1:t−1. While previous CI-3DIS approaches rely on large exemplar sets to mitigate forgetting [4],
such strategies become impractical under memory constraints. Consequently, although ER
aids knowledge retention, it is insufficient on its own for robust performance with a limited
exemplar budget. Therefore, PLG and CBR are introduced to better preserve past represen-
tations and enhance generalisation across phases. Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG).In the CI-3DIS setting, during phaset(wheret>1),
although ground-truth labels for previously seen classes are unavailable, the model from the
previous phaseΦ t−1 , which preserves knowledge of past tasks, is retained. We use this
model to generate pseudo-labels for previously seen classes, thereby providing approximate
supervision during training. This allows the current modelΦt , to retain prior knowledge and
reduce forgetting, even without access to ground-truth annotations. Given a point cloud and label pair(P,Y t ), fromD t , the previous modelΦ t−1 , generates
pseudo-labels for the previously seen classes as ˆY1:t−1 =Φ t−1 (P), which we denote as ˜Yt
1For clarity, modifications introduced by each component (ER, PLG, and CBR) are highlighted in green, blue,
and red, respectively. 6THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D
for brevity. However, we observe that utilising all predictions fromΦt−1 introduces noisy or
incorrect labels, which degrade overall performance. To mitigate this, we select the top-K
most confident instance predictions, denoted as ˜Yt
K, and concatenate them with the ground-
truth labels of the current task to obtain the supervision set: ¯Yt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt
K. Following this,
the loss is computed over both the current task’s ground-truth labels and the top-Kconfi-
dent pseudo-labels from earlier phases, enabling the model to retain prior knowledge while
adapting to new classes. Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR).While ER and PLG contribute to preserving prior
knowledge, we observe that the model’s predictions are biased towards frequent classes,
resulting in the forgetting of rare categories. This issue is further amplified by the top-K
pseudo-labels selected by PLG, which predominantly represent dominant classes in the data. To address this, we propose aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) scheme that compensates
for class imbalance using object frequency statistics. At taskt, only the current datasetD t
and its label distributionp t (c)over classesc∈ Ct are available. Datasets and class distribu-
tions from earlier tasks{D i,p i(c)}t−1
i=1 are no longer accessible, which makes it challenging
to directly account for class imbalance across all previously seen tasks. Therefore, we pro-
pose to leverage the pseudo-label predictions of the frozen modelΦ t−1 as a proxy for the
class distribution across previously learned categories. During each training iteration, the previous modelΦ t−1 is applied to the current inputP
to generate pseudo-labels ˜Yt , from which we accumulate class-wise frequency statistics for
previously learned classes. LetC1:t = St
i=1 Ci represent the union of all classes seen up to task
t. At the end of each epoch, we compute the overall class frequencyf∈R |C1:t | by combining
the pseudo-label distribution ˜pt (c)derived from ˜Yt with the ground-truth label distribution
pt (c)from the current task. The resulting frequency vectorf= [f(c)] c∈C1:t is then used to
compute class-wise weightsw= [w(c)] c∈C1:t , which guide balanced pseudo-label selection
and help the model focus on rare classes. In the next epoch, the modelΦ t−1 produces soft pseudo-label predictions ˜Yt (as de-
scribed in PLG) , where each component ˜Yt [c]denotes the confidence score for classc∈
C1:t−1. To promote balanced pseudo-label selection, class-wise re-weighting is applied using
w(c) = 1
f(c)+ε , whereεis a small constant for numerical stability. The adjusted predictions
are computed by applying the class-wise weights as: ˜Yt,w [c] =w(c)· ˜Yt [c],∀c∈ C 1:t−1. Top-Kselection is then applied to both the original and the re-weighted scores, yielding
two pseudo-label sets: ˜Yt
K and ˜Yt,w
K , respectively. The final augmented target set, Yt , is
constructed by concatenating the ground-truth labelsY t with both sets of pseudo-labels:
Yt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt
K ∥ ˜Yt,w
K .(2)
Although the above re-weighting mitigates bias from prior tasks, it does not address class
imbalance within the current taskt. To resolve this, the class-balanced weightsw c are ex-
tended to incorporate statistics from both previously seen and current classes, i.e., overC 1:t
rather than onlyC 1:t−1. The updated weights, denoted asw ′
c, are used to re-weights both
pseudo-label selection and classification loss, ensuring balanced supervision across all seen
categories, including rare ones. This unified strategy reduces bias and enhances performance
across phases. The pseudo-code for constructing the supervision set in Eq. (2), which incor-
porates both PLG and CBR components, is provided in Appendix A. Final Objective.The final training objective ofCLIMB-3D, incorporating ER, PLG, and THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D7

While CI-3DIS methods offer a wide range of practical applications, they frequently rely
on the assumption of uniform sample distribution, which rarely holds in real-world settings. In practice, the number of object categories, denoted byC, is often large and characterised
by substantial variability in category frequency, shape, structure, and size. To address these
challenges, we propose three incremental learning scenarios, each designed to capture a
different facet of real-world complexity. The design of these scenarios is detailed below; for
further information and illustrations, refer to Appendix E of the supplementary material. Split-A: Frequency Scenarios.This scenario acknowledges that datasets are often la-
belled based on the frequency of categories. To accommodate this, we propose a split where
the model learns from the most frequent categories and subsequently incorporates the less
frequent ones in later stages. By prioritising the training of frequently occurring categories,
the model can establish a strong foundation before expanding to handle rare categories. Split-B: Semantic Scenarios.Beyond frequency, semantic similarity is crucial in real-
world deployments. While objects often share visual or functional traits, models may en-
counter semantically different categories in new environments. To simulate this challenge,
we introduce theSplit-Bscenario. Here, categories are grouped based on their semantic
relationships, and the model is incrementally trained on one semantic group at a time. This
setup encourages the model to generalise across semantically similar categories and adapt
more effectively when exposed to new ones. Unlike theSplit-Ascenario, which organises
learning based on category frequency, theSplit-Bscenario may contain both frequent and
infrequent categories within a single task, focusing on semantic continuity and transfer. Split-C: Random Scenarios.In some cases, data labelling is driven by the availability of
objects rather than predefined criteria. To capture this, we introduce theSplit-Cscenario,
which represents a fully random setting where any class can appear in any task, resulting in
varying levels of class imbalance. By exposing the model to such diverse and unpredictable
distributions, we aim to improve its robustness in real-world situations where labelled data
availability is inconsistent. These incremental scenarios are designed to provide a more realistic representation of
object distributions, frequencies, and dynamics encountered in the real world. 4 Experiments

assessing real-world scenarios. In addition, we compare our approach against existing in-
cremental learning methods using ScanNetV2 [16] in the 3DSS setting. For this evaluation,
we follow the standard training and validation splits defined in prior works [74] to ensure
consistency with existing methods. Evaluation Metrics.We evaluate our method usingMean Average Precision(mAP), a
standard metric for 3DIS which provides a comprehensive measure of segmentation quality
by accounting for both precision and recall. For comparison with existing 3DSS methods,
we report themean Intersection over Union(mIoU), which quantifies the overlap between
predicted and ground truth segments. To assess the model’s ability to mitigate catastrophic
forgetting in incremental settings, we use theForgetting Percentage Points(FPP) metric, as
defined in [47]. FPP captures performance degradation by measuring the accuracy drop on
the initially seen categories between the first and final training phases. Detailed descriptions of the incremental scenarios (Split-A,Split-B,Split-C) and im-
plementation are provided in Appendix B. 4.2 Results and Discussion

To evaluate our proposed approach, we construct a baseline using ER [5] for the 3DIS
setting, as no existing incremental baselines are available for this task. In contrast, for the
3DSS setting, where incremental baselines do exist, we compare our method against three
prior approaches [43, 60, 74]. Results on CI-3DIS.Tab. 1 compares CLIMB-3D against the ER baseline across the three
CI-3DIS scenarios, evaluated after all phases using mAP 25, mAP50, overall mAP, and FPP. In theSplit-Ascenario, characterised by significant distribution shifts, our method achieves
gains of +19.23%, +16.76%, and +12.28% in mAP 25, mAP 50, and overall mAP, respec-
tively, while drastically reducing forgetting with FPP scores of 3.44% (mAP 25) and 2.63%
(mAP50), both over 45 points lower than the baseline. Under theSplit-Bscenario, with
semantically related new categories, improvements of +18.26%, +16.49%, and +12.76%
are observed alongside a reduction in forgetting to 8.00% and 5.51% from baseline levels
above 42%. For theSplit-Cscenario, featuring increasing geometric complexity, CLIMB-
3D maintains solid gains of +5.94%, +5.70%, and +4.08% across mAP metrics, with forget-
ting reduced by over 22 points. Overall, these results demonstrate robust forward transfer,
minimal forgetting, and stable learning, highlighting the method’s effectiveness for scalable
continual 3D semantic understanding. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D9

Results on CI-3DSS.Although our primary focus is on CI-3DIS, we also evaluate our
method under the CI-3DSS setting to enable comparisons with existing approaches. To do
so, we adapt our predictions to assign each point the label corresponding to the highest-
confidence mask and exclude background classes (e.g., floor and wall), as these are not part
of the semantic segmentation targets. Tab. 2 presents a comparison between our method and
existing baselines on the ScanNet V2 dataset [16], evaluated using mIoU across two training
phases and overall. Although originally designed for instance segmentation, our method
generalises effectively to semantic segmentation, achieving substantial gains of +35.23%
mIoU in Phase 1 and +19.1% in Phase 2. Overall, it achieves 59.38% mIoU, significantly
higher than the∼30% mIoU of prior methods, highlighting its robustness and transferability. Refer to Appendix C, D, and F of the supplementary material for detailed analyses of per-
phase performance, rare-class evaluation, and qualitative result comparisons, respectively. 4.3 Ablation

We conduct an ablation study to evaluate the contribution of each component in our
framework. As an upper bound, we report the performance of anOraclemodel, which is
trained jointly on the full dataset. For the incremental setting, we follow the previously
defined splits and first train the model naively across phases. We then incrementally add
each module to isolate its impact. Tab. 3 presents results for theSplit-Ascenario using both
mAP50 and FPP metrics. Naïve Training.When trained naïvely without any dedicated modules, the model suffers
from severe catastrophic forgetting, as evident in row 2. The model entirely forgets pre-
viously learned classes upon entering new phases, with performance dropping to zero for
earlier splits and FPP rising to 56.82. 10THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D
Effect of ER.Adding exemplar replay (row 3) partially alleviates forgetting by maintaining
a buffer of past examples. This yields notable gains fors1in Phase 2 (+18.51%) and Phase 3
(+10.38%), and also improvess2in Phase 3 (+9.43%). However, the overall forgetting
remains substantial (FPP: 46.44), showing ER alone is insufficient. Effect of PLG.The addition of the pseudo-label generator (PLG), which generates labels for
previous classes by retaining a copy of the model from an earlier phase, facilitates knowledge
retention and forward transfer. As shown in row 4, PLG significantly reduces forgetting and
enhances performance on current tasks. Fors1, it improves mAP 50 by 31.49% in Phase 2
and 39.40% in Phase 3 over exemplar replay. Overall, PLG yields a 15.00% increase in
performance and reduces forgetting by 39.40%. Effect of CBR.Finally, class-balanced re-weighting (CBR) mitigates class imbalance dur-
ing both pseudo-labelling and current task learning by adjusting each class’s contribution
based on its frequency. As shown in row 5, CBR enhancess1retention over PLG in Phases 2
and 3 (+4.67% and +4.41%), and further improves performance ons2ands3. It also achieves
the lowest FPP of 2.63, reflecting strong forgetting mitigation. Overall, CBR offers the best
trade-off between retaining past knowledge and acquiring new tasks, outperforming PLG
and ER by 4.41% and 43.81%, respectively. 4.4 Limitations & Future Work
While CLIMB-3D achieves strong performance across CI-3DIS and CI-3DSS settings, sev-
eral limitations remain and warrant discussion. The experiments are currently limited to
indoor datasets (ScanNet200 and ScanNetV2), therefore evaluating performance on outdoor
scenes would help assess generalisability across diverse environments. The current setup
also considers only three incremental phases, whereas real-world applications often involve
longer sequences; incorporating such extended setups would better reflect practical chal-
lenges. Moreover, the model operates in a uni-modal setting. Integrating multi-modal cues,
such as vision-language models, could further enhance performance, as suggested by recent
2D and 3D studies [25, 65, 66]. 5 Conclusion
This work addresses the challenge of catastrophic forgetting in class-incremental 3D in-
stance segmentation by introducing a modular framework that integrates exemplar replay
(ER), a pseudo-label generator (PLG), and class-balanced re-weighting (CBR). The pro-
posed method incrementally adapts to new classes while preserving prior knowledge, all
without requiring access to the full dataset. Extensive experiments on a three-phase bench-
mark validate the individual and combined effectiveness of each component: ER enables
efficient memory-based retention; PLG facilitates knowledge preservation through pseudo-
supervision; and CBR mitigates class imbalance to enhance learning stability. Together,
these components significantly reduce forgetting and improve segmentation performance
across all phases. By achieving a strong balance between stability and plasticity, our ap-
proach advances continual 3D scene understanding and sets a new baseline for future re-
search in this area. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D11

1 Introduction
Table Chair Couch Pillow Coffee Table Sofa Chair Recycling BinCabinet Unknown
Task-1 Task-2 Task-3
Figure 1:Overview of the CI-3DIS setting.New object categories are introduced incre-
mentally with each task. After every phase, the model must recognise both newly added
and previously learned classes. For instance, in Task 2, categories such asPillow,Coffee
Table, andSofa Chairare introduced, while the model is expected to retain recognition
of earlier classes likeTable,Chair, andCouch. 3D instance segmentation (3DIS) is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves
identifying precise object boundaries and class labels in 3D space, with broad applications in
graphics, robotics, and augmented reality [4, 39]. Traditional 3DIS methods, including top-
down [28, 70, 78], bottom-up [26, 73], and transformer-based approaches [59], perform well
under the assumption that all classes are available and balanced during training. However,
this assumption does not hold in real-world environments, where new object classes emerge
over time and exhibit natural imbalance. This gap motivates the need for Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) [17, 54], which sup-
ports learning new categories while retaining knowledge of previous ones [51]. While CIL
has seen success in 2D image tasks [1, 43, 54, 60], extensions to 3D point clouds remain
limited, often focusing on object-level classification [13, 18, 48]. Recent works on scene-
level class-incremental 3DIS (CI-3DIS) [4] and class-incremental semantic segmentation
(CI-3DSS) [74] show promise, but depend heavily on large exemplar [56] and overlook class
imbalance, limiting their practicality. To address this, we proposeCLIMB-3D, a unified framework forCLass-incremental
IMBalance-aware3DIS that jointly tackles catastrophic forgetting and class imbalance. The
framework begins with Exemplar Replay (ER), storing a small number of samples from
past classes for later replay. However, this alone does not yield promising results under the
strict memory constraints required in CI-3DIS. To address this, we introduce a Pseudo-Label
Generator (PLG), which uses a frozen model from previous task to generate supervision for
earlier classes. However, we observed that PLG tends to favour frequent classes while ig-
noring under-represented ones. To mitigate this, we propose a Class-Balanced Re-weighting
(CBR), which estimates class frequencies from the pseudo-labels to enhance the learning of
rare classes without accessing past data. Together, these components form a practical and
effective solution for real-world 3DIS. To evaluate CLIMB-3D, we designed three benchmark scenarios for CI-3DIS based on
the ScanNet200 dataset [57]. These scenarios simulate incremental learning setup under nat-
ural class imbalance, where new classes emerge based on (A) object frequency, (B) semantic
similarity, or (C) random grouping. Additionally, for comparison with existing methods,
we evaluate our approach on CI-3DSS using the ScanNetV2 dataset [16]. Experimental re-
sults show that our method significantly reduces forgetting and improves performance across
both frequent and rare categories, outperforming previous methods in both settings. Fig. 1
illustrates the CI-3DIS setup. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D3
In summary, our contributions are: (i) a novel problem setting of imbalanced class-
incremental 3DIS with an effective method to balance learning and mitigate forgetting; (ii)
three benchmarks modelling continual object emergence with natural imbalance; and (iii)
strong experimental results, achieving up to 16.76% mAP improvement over baselines. 2 Related Work
3D Instance Segmentation.Various methods have been proposed for 3DIS. Grouping-
based approaches adopt a bottom-up pipeline that learns latent embeddings for point cluster-
ing [9, 21, 22, 29, 37, 44, 70, 78]. In contrast, proposal-based methods follow a top-down
strategy by detecting 3D boxes and segmenting objects within them [19, 26, 46, 73, 76]. Recently, transformer-based models [68] have also been applied to 3DIS and 3DSS [59, 64],
inspired by advances in 2D vision [10, 11]. However, these approaches require full anno-
tations for all classes and are not designed for progressive learning, where only new class
annotations are available and previous data is inaccessible. Another line of work aims to re-
duce annotation costs by proposing weakly supervised 3DIS methods based on sparse cues
[12, 27, 72]. While effective with limited annotations, these methods assume a fixed set of
classes and are susceptible to catastrophic forgetting in incremental settings. Incremental Learning.Continual learning involves training models sequentially to miti-
gate catastrophic forgetting. One common strategy is model regularisation, which constrains
parameter updates using techniques such as elastic weight consolidation or knowledge dis-
tillation [1, 24, 35, 43, 60]. Another approach is exemplar replay, where past data is stored
or generated to rehearse older tasks while learning new ones [5, 7, 30, 54]. A third direc-
tion involves dynamically expanding the model architecture or using modular sub-networks
to accommodate new tasks without interfering with old ones [31, 42, 53, 58, 71, 79]. Re-
cent efforts in class-incremental 3D segmentation [63, 74] have shown early promise but
often rely on basic architectures and focus primarily on semantic segmentation. Other works
[4, 36] explore continual learning in 3D settings, though they often depend on large memory
buffers. In contrast, our work introduces a tailored framework for 3D instance segmentation
that effectively transfers knowledge across tasks, even under class imbalance. Long-tailed Recognition.Imbalanced class distributions lead to poor recognition of rare
(long-tail) classes. To address this, re-sampling methods balance the data via input [8, 20, 50,
52, 61] or feature space [3, 14, 40], avoiding naïve under-/over-sampling. Loss re-weighting
offers another direction, using class-based [6, 15, 23, 32, 33, 69] or per-example [45, 55, 62]
adjustments to ensure fair contribution. Parameter regularisation improves generalisation
through weight constraints [2], albeit requiring careful tuning. Other approaches leverage
transfer learning [77, 81], self-supervision [41, 75], or contrastive learning [34, 41, 82] to
improve rare-class representations. Long-tailed recognition is well-studied in 2D with large-
scale datasets [15, 49, 67]; in 3D, ScanNet200 [16, 57] enables similar efforts. Prior 3D
work focused on re-weighting, re-sampling, and transfer learning [57], while regularisation
remains underexplored. CeCo [80] balances class centres via auxiliary loss but overlooks
sampling and augmentation. Lahoud et al. [38] propose adaptive classifier regularisation
for 3D segmentation, outperforming prior approaches without threshold tuning. However,
neither method considers incremental learning. In contrast, we jointly address long-tail and
continual 3D semantic segmentation. 4THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D

Figure 2: Overview ofCLIMB-3Dfor CI-3DIS. The model incrementally learns new classes
across sequential phases. During taskt, point cloudsPand their corresponding labelsY t are
sampled from a combination of the current training datasetD t and Exemplar Replay (ER),
which maintains a small memory of past examples. These are then passed to the current
modelΦ t to produce predicted labelsY t . The Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG) selects the
top-Kpredictions from the previous modelΦ t−1 . These pseudo-labels are then weighted
based on class frequencyf(c)using Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR), and the top-Kre-
weighted labels are selected to form the balanced pseudo-label set ¯Yt . This pseudo-label set
is then concatenated with the ground-truth labels to form a final augmented supervision set
Yt for taskt, which is used to optimise the modelΦ t using Eq. (3). 3 Methodology
3.1 Problem Formulation
3DIS.The objective of this task is to detect and segment each object instance within a point
cloud. Formally, the training dataset is denoted asD={(P i,Yi)}N
i=1, whereNis the number
of training samples. Each inputP i ∈R M×6 is a coloured point cloud consisting ofMpoints,
where each point is represented by its 3D coordinates and RGB values. The corresponding
annotationY i ={(m i,j ,ci,j )}Ji
j=1 containsJ i object instances, wheremi,j ∈ {0,1}M is a binary
mask indicating which points belong to thej-th instance, andc i,j ∈ C={1,...,C}is the
semantic class label of that instance. GivenP i, the modelΦpredicts instance-level outputs
ˆYi ={(ˆmi,j ,ˆci,j )}
ˆJi
j=1, where ˆmi,j and ˆci,j denote the predicted mask and category label for
thej-th instance, respectively. The number of predicted instances ˆJi varies depending on the
model’s inference. The model is optimised using the following objective:
L3DIS(D;Φ) = 1

whereL cls andL mask are the average classification and mask losses over all instances, andλ
controls their trade-off. CI-3DIS.Unlike conventional 3DIS, CI-3DIS involves sequential learning, where object
categories are introduced incrementally overTtraining tasks. Each tasktintroduces a dis-
joint set of classesC t , withC= ST

Overview.As shown in Fig. 2 and formulated in Sec. 3.1, the proposed framework for
CI-3DIS follows aphase-wisetraining strategy. In each phase, the model is exposed to a
carefully curated subset of the dataset, simulating real-world scenarios discussed in Sec. 3.3. Training naïvely on such phased data leads tocatastrophic forgetting[51], where the model
forgets prior knowledge when learning new tasks. To address this, we first incorporateEx-
emplar Replay(ER) [5], a strategy inspired by 2D incremental methods [1, 43, 54] and
recently extended to 3D settings [4], to mitigate forgetting by storing a small set of repre-
sentative samples from earlier phases. However, ER alone is insufficient to achieve robust
performance. To address this, two additional components are introduced: aPseudo-Label
Generator(PLG), which leverages a frozen model to generate supervision signals for previ-
ously seen classes, and aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) module that compensates for
class imbalance across phases. Each of these components is described in detail below 1. Exemplar Replay (ER).Inspired by Buzzega et al. [5], ER addresses the issue of catas-
trophic forgetting by allowing the model to retain a subset of data from earlier phases. During phaset, the model is trained not only on the current task dataD t , but also on a
set of exemplarsE 1:t−1, collected from previous phases. These exemplars are accumulated
incrementally:E 1:t−1 =E 1 ∪···∪E t−1 .Here,E t denotes the exemplar subset stored after
phaset, and|E t |denotes the exemplar replay size. The combined replay dataset is denoted
as:D t
ER =D t ∪E 1:t−1.Epoch training consists of two stages: first, the model is trained on
the current data,D t ; then it is trained using exemplars fromE 1:t−1. While previous CI-3DIS approaches rely on large exemplar sets to mitigate forgetting [4],
such strategies become impractical under memory constraints. Consequently, although ER
aids knowledge retention, it is insufficient on its own for robust performance with a limited
exemplar budget. Therefore, PLG and CBR are introduced to better preserve past represen-
tations and enhance generalisation across phases. Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG).In the CI-3DIS setting, during phaset(wheret>1),
although ground-truth labels for previously seen classes are unavailable, the model from the
previous phaseΦ t−1 , which preserves knowledge of past tasks, is retained. We use this
model to generate pseudo-labels for previously seen classes, thereby providing approximate
supervision during training. This allows the current modelΦt , to retain prior knowledge and
reduce forgetting, even without access to ground-truth annotations. Given a point cloud and label pair(P,Y t ), fromD t , the previous modelΦ t−1 , generates
pseudo-labels for the previously seen classes as ˆY1:t−1 =Φ t−1 (P), which we denote as ˜Yt
1For clarity, modifications introduced by each component (ER, PLG, and CBR) are highlighted in green, blue,
and red, respectively. 6THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D
for brevity. However, we observe that utilising all predictions fromΦt−1 introduces noisy or
incorrect labels, which degrade overall performance. To mitigate this, we select the top-K
most confident instance predictions, denoted as ˜Yt
K, and concatenate them with the ground-
truth labels of the current task to obtain the supervision set: ¯Yt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt
K. Following this,
the loss is computed over both the current task’s ground-truth labels and the top-Kconfi-
dent pseudo-labels from earlier phases, enabling the model to retain prior knowledge while
adapting to new classes. Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR).While ER and PLG contribute to preserving prior
knowledge, we observe that the model’s predictions are biased towards frequent classes,
resulting in the forgetting of rare categories. This issue is further amplified by the top-K
pseudo-labels selected by PLG, which predominantly represent dominant classes in the data. To address this, we propose aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) scheme that compensates
for class imbalance using object frequency statistics. At taskt, only the current datasetD t
and its label distributionp t (c)over classesc∈ Ct are available. Datasets and class distribu-
tions from earlier tasks{D i,p i(c)}t−1
i=1 are no longer accessible, which makes it challenging
to directly account for class imbalance across all previously seen tasks. Therefore, we pro-
pose to leverage the pseudo-label predictions of the frozen modelΦ t−1 as a proxy for the
class distribution across previously learned categories. During each training iteration, the previous modelΦ t−1 is applied to the current inputP
to generate pseudo-labels ˜Yt , from which we accumulate class-wise frequency statistics for
previously learned classes. LetC1:t = St
i=1 Ci represent the union of all classes seen up to task
t. At the end of each epoch, we compute the overall class frequencyf∈R |C1:t | by combining
the pseudo-label distribution ˜pt (c)derived from ˜Yt with the ground-truth label distribution
pt (c)from the current task. The resulting frequency vectorf= [f(c)] c∈C1:t is then used to
compute class-wise weightsw= [w(c)] c∈C1:t , which guide balanced pseudo-label selection
and help the model focus on rare classes. In the next epoch, the modelΦ t−1 produces soft pseudo-label predictions ˜Yt (as de-
scribed in PLG) , where each component ˜Yt [c]denotes the confidence score for classc∈
C1:t−1. To promote balanced pseudo-label selection, class-wise re-weighting is applied using
w(c) = 1
f(c)+ε , whereεis a small constant for numerical stability. The adjusted predictions
are computed by applying the class-wise weights as: ˜Yt,w [c] =w(c)· ˜Yt [c],∀c∈ C 1:t−1. Top-Kselection is then applied to both the original and the re-weighted scores, yielding
two pseudo-label sets: ˜Yt
K and ˜Yt,w
K , respectively. The final augmented target set, Yt , is
constructed by concatenating the ground-truth labelsY t with both sets of pseudo-labels:
Yt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt
K ∥ ˜Yt,w
K .(2)
Although the above re-weighting mitigates bias from prior tasks, it does not address class
imbalance within the current taskt. To resolve this, the class-balanced weightsw c are ex-
tended to incorporate statistics from both previously seen and current classes, i.e., overC 1:t
rather than onlyC 1:t−1. The updated weights, denoted asw ′
c, are used to re-weights both
pseudo-label selection and classification loss, ensuring balanced supervision across all seen
categories, including rare ones. This unified strategy reduces bias and enhances performance
across phases. The pseudo-code for constructing the supervision set in Eq. (2), which incor-
porates both PLG and CBR components, is provided in Appendix A. Final Objective.The final training objective ofCLIMB-3D, incorporating ER, PLG, and THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D7

While CI-3DIS methods offer a wide range of practical applications, they frequently rely
on the assumption of uniform sample distribution, which rarely holds in real-world settings. In practice, the number of object categories, denoted byC, is often large and characterised
by substantial variability in category frequency, shape, structure, and size. To address these
challenges, we propose three incremental learning scenarios, each designed to capture a
different facet of real-world complexity. The design of these scenarios is detailed below; for
further information and illustrations, refer to Appendix E of the supplementary material. Split-A: Frequency Scenarios.This scenario acknowledges that datasets are often la-
belled based on the frequency of categories. To accommodate this, we propose a split where
the model learns from the most frequent categories and subsequently incorporates the less
frequent ones in later stages. By prioritising the training of frequently occurring categories,
the model can establish a strong foundation before expanding to handle rare categories. Split-B: Semantic Scenarios.Beyond frequency, semantic similarity is crucial in real-
world deployments. While objects often share visual or functional traits, models may en-
counter semantically different categories in new environments. To simulate this challenge,
we introduce theSplit-Bscenario. Here, categories are grouped based on their semantic
relationships, and the model is incrementally trained on one semantic group at a time. This
setup encourages the model to generalise across semantically similar categories and adapt
more effectively when exposed to new ones. Unlike theSplit-Ascenario, which organises
learning based on category frequency, theSplit-Bscenario may contain both frequent and
infrequent categories within a single task, focusing on semantic continuity and transfer. Split-C: Random Scenarios.In some cases, data labelling is driven by the availability of
objects rather than predefined criteria. To capture this, we introduce theSplit-Cscenario,
which represents a fully random setting where any class can appear in any task, resulting in
varying levels of class imbalance. By exposing the model to such diverse and unpredictable
distributions, we aim to improve its robustness in real-world situations where labelled data
availability is inconsistent. These incremental scenarios are designed to provide a more realistic representation of
object distributions, frequencies, and dynamics encountered in the real world. 4 Experiments

assessing real-world scenarios. In addition, we compare our approach against existing in-
cremental learning methods using ScanNetV2 [16] in the 3DSS setting. For this evaluation,
we follow the standard training and validation splits defined in prior works [74] to ensure
consistency with existing methods. Evaluation Metrics.We evaluate our method usingMean Average Precision(mAP), a
standard metric for 3DIS which provides a comprehensive measure of segmentation quality
by accounting for both precision and recall. For comparison with existing 3DSS methods,
we report themean Intersection over Union(mIoU), which quantifies the overlap between
predicted and ground truth segments. To assess the model’s ability to mitigate catastrophic
forgetting in incremental settings, we use theForgetting Percentage Points(FPP) metric, as
defined in [47]. FPP captures performance degradation by measuring the accuracy drop on
the initially seen categories between the first and final training phases. Detailed descriptions of the incremental scenarios (Split-A,Split-B,Split-C) and im-
plementation are provided in Appendix B. 4.2 Results and Discussion

To evaluate our proposed approach, we construct a baseline using ER [5] for the 3DIS
setting, as no existing incremental baselines are available for this task. In contrast, for the
3DSS setting, where incremental baselines do exist, we compare our method against three
prior approaches [43, 60, 74]. Results on CI-3DIS.Tab. 1 compares CLIMB-3D against the ER baseline across the three
CI-3DIS scenarios, evaluated after all phases using mAP 25, mAP50, overall mAP, and FPP. In theSplit-Ascenario, characterised by significant distribution shifts, our method achieves
gains of +19.23%, +16.76%, and +12.28% in mAP 25, mAP 50, and overall mAP, respec-
tively, while drastically reducing forgetting with FPP scores of 3.44% (mAP 25) and 2.63%
(mAP50), both over 45 points lower than the baseline. Under theSplit-Bscenario, with
semantically related new categories, improvements of +18.26%, +16.49%, and +12.76%
are observed alongside a reduction in forgetting to 8.00% and 5.51% from baseline levels
above 42%. For theSplit-Cscenario, featuring increasing geometric complexity, CLIMB-
3D maintains solid gains of +5.94%, +5.70%, and +4.08% across mAP metrics, with forget-
ting reduced by over 22 points. Overall, these results demonstrate robust forward transfer,
minimal forgetting, and stable learning, highlighting the method’s effectiveness for scalable
continual 3D semantic understanding. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D9

Results on CI-3DSS.Although our primary focus is on CI-3DIS, we also evaluate our
method under the CI-3DSS setting to enable comparisons with existing approaches. To do
so, we adapt our predictions to assign each point the label corresponding to the highest-
confidence mask and exclude background classes (e.g., floor and wall), as these are not part
of the semantic segmentation targets. Tab. 2 presents a comparison between our method and
existing baselines on the ScanNet V2 dataset [16], evaluated using mIoU across two training
phases and overall. Although originally designed for instance segmentation, our method
generalises effectively to semantic segmentation, achieving substantial gains of +35.23%
mIoU in Phase 1 and +19.1% in Phase 2. Overall, it achieves 59.38% mIoU, significantly
higher than the∼30% mIoU of prior methods, highlighting its robustness and transferability. Refer to Appendix C, D, and F of the supplementary material for detailed analyses of per-
phase performance, rare-class evaluation, and qualitative result comparisons, respectively. 4.3 Ablation

We conduct an ablation study to evaluate the contribution of each component in our
framework. As an upper bound, we report the performance of anOraclemodel, which is
trained jointly on the full dataset. For the incremental setting, we follow the previously
defined splits and first train the model naively across phases. We then incrementally add
each module to isolate its impact. Tab. 3 presents results for theSplit-Ascenario using both
mAP50 and FPP metrics. Naïve Training.When trained naïvely without any dedicated modules, the model suffers
from severe catastrophic forgetting, as evident in row 2. The model entirely forgets pre-
viously learned classes upon entering new phases, with performance dropping to zero for
earlier splits and FPP rising to 56.82. 10THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D
Effect of ER.Adding exemplar replay (row 3) partially alleviates forgetting by maintaining
a buffer of past examples. This yields notable gains fors1in Phase 2 (+18.51%) and Phase 3
(+10.38%), and also improvess2in Phase 3 (+9.43%). However, the overall forgetting
remains substantial (FPP: 46.44), showing ER alone is insufficient. Effect of PLG.The addition of the pseudo-label generator (PLG), which generates labels for
previous classes by retaining a copy of the model from an earlier phase, facilitates knowledge
retention and forward transfer. As shown in row 4, PLG significantly reduces forgetting and
enhances performance on current tasks. Fors1, it improves mAP 50 by 31.49% in Phase 2
and 39.40% in Phase 3 over exemplar replay. Overall, PLG yields a 15.00% increase in
performance and reduces forgetting by 39.40%. Effect of CBR.Finally, class-balanced re-weighting (CBR) mitigates class imbalance dur-
ing both pseudo-labelling and current task learning by adjusting each class’s contribution
based on its frequency. As shown in row 5, CBR enhancess1retention over PLG in Phases 2
and 3 (+4.67% and +4.41%), and further improves performance ons2ands3. It also achieves
the lowest FPP of 2.63, reflecting strong forgetting mitigation. Overall, CBR offers the best
trade-off between retaining past knowledge and acquiring new tasks, outperforming PLG
and ER by 4.41% and 43.81%, respectively. 4.4 Limitations & Future Work
While CLIMB-3D achieves strong performance across CI-3DIS and CI-3DSS settings, sev-
eral limitations remain and warrant discussion. The experiments are currently limited to
indoor datasets (ScanNet200 and ScanNetV2), therefore evaluating performance on outdoor
scenes would help assess generalisability across diverse environments. The current setup
also considers only three incremental phases, whereas real-world applications often involve
longer sequences; incorporating such extended setups would better reflect practical chal-
lenges. Moreover, the model operates in a uni-modal setting. Integrating multi-modal cues,
such as vision-language models, could further enhance performance, as suggested by recent
2D and 3D studies [25, 65, 66]. 5 Conclusion
This work addresses the challenge of catastrophic forgetting in class-incremental 3D in-
stance segmentation by introducing a modular framework that integrates exemplar replay
(ER), a pseudo-label generator (PLG), and class-balanced re-weighting (CBR). The pro-
posed method incrementally adapts to new classes while preserving prior knowledge, all
without requiring access to the full dataset. Extensive experiments on a three-phase bench-
mark validate the individual and combined effectiveness of each component: ER enables
efficient memory-based retention; PLG facilitates knowledge preservation through pseudo-
supervision; and CBR mitigates class imbalance to enhance learning stability. Together,
these components significantly reduce forgetting and improve segmentation performance
across all phases. By achieving a strong balance between stability and plasticity, our ap-
proach advances continual 3D scene understanding and sets a new baseline for future re-
search in this area. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D11

1 Introduction
Table Chair Couch Pillow Coffee Table Sofa Chair Recycling BinCabinet Unknown
Task-1 Task-2 Task-3
Figure 1:Overview of the CI-3DIS setting.New object categories are introduced incre-
mentally with each task. After every phase, the model must recognise both newly added
and previously learned classes. For instance, in Task 2, categories such asPillow,Coffee
Table, andSofa Chairare introduced, while the model is expected to retain recognition
of earlier classes likeTable,Chair, andCouch. 3D instance segmentation (3DIS) is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves
identifying precise object boundaries and class labels in 3D space, with broad applications in
graphics, robotics, and augmented reality [4, 39]. Traditional 3DIS methods, including top-
down [28, 70, 78], bottom-up [26, 73], and transformer-based approaches [59], perform well
under the assumption that all classes are available and balanced during training. However,
this assumption does not hold in real-world environments, where new object classes emerge
over time and exhibit natural imbalance. This gap motivates the need for Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) [17, 54], which sup-
ports learning new categories while retaining knowledge of previous ones [51]. While CIL
has seen success in 2D image tasks [1, 43, 54, 60], extensions to 3D point clouds remain
limited, often focusing on object-level classification [13, 18, 48]. Recent works on scene-
level class-incremental 3DIS (CI-3DIS) [4] and class-incremental semantic segmentation
(CI-3DSS) [74] show promise, but depend heavily on large exemplar [56] and overlook class
imbalance, limiting their practicality. To address this, we proposeCLIMB-3D, a unified framework forCLass-incremental
IMBalance-aware3DIS that jointly tackles catastrophic forgetting and class imbalance. The
framework begins with Exemplar Replay (ER), storing a small number of samples from
past classes for later replay. However, this alone does not yield promising results under the
strict memory constraints required in CI-3DIS. To address this, we introduce a Pseudo-Label
Generator (PLG), which uses a frozen model from previous task to generate supervision for
earlier classes. However, we observed that PLG tends to favour frequent classes while ig-
noring under-represented ones. To mitigate this, we propose a Class-Balanced Re-weighting
(CBR), which estimates class frequencies from the pseudo-labels to enhance the learning of
rare classes without accessing past data. Together, these components form a practical and
effective solution for real-world 3DIS. To evaluate CLIMB-3D, we designed three benchmark scenarios for CI-3DIS based on
the ScanNet200 dataset [57]. These scenarios simulate incremental learning setup under nat-
ural class imbalance, where new classes emerge based on (A) object frequency, (B) semantic
similarity, or (C) random grouping. Additionally, for comparison with existing methods,
we evaluate our approach on CI-3DSS using the ScanNetV2 dataset [16]. Experimental re-
sults show that our method significantly reduces forgetting and improves performance across
both frequent and rare categories, outperforming previous methods in both settings. Fig. 1
illustrates the CI-3DIS setup. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D3
In summary, our contributions are: (i) a novel problem setting of imbalanced class-
incremental 3DIS with an effective method to balance learning and mitigate forgetting; (ii)
three benchmarks modelling continual object emergence with natural imbalance; and (iii)
strong experimental results, achieving up to 16.76% mAP improvement over baselines. 2 Related Work
3D Instance Segmentation.Various methods have been proposed for 3DIS. Grouping-
based approaches adopt a bottom-up pipeline that learns latent embeddings for point cluster-
ing [9, 21, 22, 29, 37, 44, 70, 78]. In contrast, proposal-based methods follow a top-down
strategy by detecting 3D boxes and segmenting objects within them [19, 26, 46, 73, 76]. Recently, transformer-based models [68] have also been applied to 3DIS and 3DSS [59, 64],
inspired by advances in 2D vision [10, 11]. However, these approaches require full anno-
tations for all classes and are not designed for progressive learning, where only new class
annotations are available and previous data is inaccessible. Another line of work aims to re-
duce annotation costs by proposing weakly supervised 3DIS methods based on sparse cues
[12, 27, 72]. While effective with limited annotations, these methods assume a fixed set of
classes and are susceptible to catastrophic forgetting in incremental settings. Incremental Learning.Continual learning involves training models sequentially to miti-
gate catastrophic forgetting. One common strategy is model regularisation, which constrains
parameter updates using techniques such as elastic weight consolidation or knowledge dis-
tillation [1, 24, 35, 43, 60]. Another approach is exemplar replay, where past data is stored
or generated to rehearse older tasks while learning new ones [5, 7, 30, 54]. A third direc-
tion involves dynamically expanding the model architecture or using modular sub-networks
to accommodate new tasks without interfering with old ones [31, 42, 53, 58, 71, 79]. Re-
cent efforts in class-incremental 3D segmentation [63, 74] have shown early promise but
often rely on basic architectures and focus primarily on semantic segmentation. Other works
[4, 36] explore continual learning in 3D settings, though they often depend on large memory
buffers. In contrast, our work introduces a tailored framework for 3D instance segmentation
that effectively transfers knowledge across tasks, even under class imbalance. Long-tailed Recognition.Imbalanced class distributions lead to poor recognition of rare
(long-tail) classes. To address this, re-sampling methods balance the data via input [8, 20, 50,
52, 61] or feature space [3, 14, 40], avoiding naïve under-/over-sampling. Loss re-weighting
offers another direction, using class-based [6, 15, 23, 32, 33, 69] or per-example [45, 55, 62]
adjustments to ensure fair contribution. Parameter regularisation improves generalisation
through weight constraints [2], albeit requiring careful tuning. Other approaches leverage
transfer learning [77, 81], self-supervision [41, 75], or contrastive learning [34, 41, 82] to
improve rare-class representations. Long-tailed recognition is well-studied in 2D with large-
scale datasets [15, 49, 67]; in 3D, ScanNet200 [16, 57] enables similar efforts. Prior 3D
work focused on re-weighting, re-sampling, and transfer learning [57], while regularisation
remains underexplored. CeCo [80] balances class centres via auxiliary loss but overlooks
sampling and augmentation. Lahoud et al. [38] propose adaptive classifier regularisation
for 3D segmentation, outperforming prior approaches without threshold tuning. However,
neither method considers incremental learning. In contrast, we jointly address long-tail and
continual 3D semantic segmentation. 4THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D

Figure 2: Overview ofCLIMB-3Dfor CI-3DIS. The model incrementally learns new classes
across sequential phases. During taskt, point cloudsPand their corresponding labelsY t are
sampled from a combination of the current training datasetD t and Exemplar Replay (ER),
which maintains a small memory of past examples. These are then passed to the current
modelΦ t to produce predicted labelsY t . The Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG) selects the
top-Kpredictions from the previous modelΦ t−1 . These pseudo-labels are then weighted
based on class frequencyf(c)using Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR), and the top-Kre-
weighted labels are selected to form the balanced pseudo-label set ¯Yt . This pseudo-label set
is then concatenated with the ground-truth labels to form a final augmented supervision set
Yt for taskt, which is used to optimise the modelΦ t using Eq. (3). 3 Methodology
3.1 Problem Formulation
3DIS.The objective of this task is to detect and segment each object instance within a point
cloud. Formally, the training dataset is denoted asD={(P i,Yi)}N
i=1, whereNis the number
of training samples. Each inputP i ∈R M×6 is a coloured point cloud consisting ofMpoints,
where each point is represented by its 3D coordinates and RGB values. The corresponding
annotationY i ={(m i,j ,ci,j )}Ji
j=1 containsJ i object instances, wheremi,j ∈ {0,1}M is a binary
mask indicating which points belong to thej-th instance, andc i,j ∈ C={1,...,C}is the
semantic class label of that instance. GivenP i, the modelΦpredicts instance-level outputs
ˆYi ={(ˆmi,j ,ˆci,j )}
ˆJi
j=1, where ˆmi,j and ˆci,j denote the predicted mask and category label for
thej-th instance, respectively. The number of predicted instances ˆJi varies depending on the
model’s inference. The model is optimised using the following objective:
L3DIS(D;Φ) = 1

whereL cls andL mask are the average classification and mask losses over all instances, andλ
controls their trade-off. CI-3DIS.Unlike conventional 3DIS, CI-3DIS involves sequential learning, where object
categories are introduced incrementally overTtraining tasks. Each tasktintroduces a dis-
joint set of classesC t , withC= ST

Overview.As shown in Fig. 2 and formulated in Sec. 3.1, the proposed framework for
CI-3DIS follows aphase-wisetraining strategy. In each phase, the model is exposed to a
carefully curated subset of the dataset, simulating real-world scenarios discussed in Sec. 3.3. Training naïvely on such phased data leads tocatastrophic forgetting[51], where the model
forgets prior knowledge when learning new tasks. To address this, we first incorporateEx-
emplar Replay(ER) [5], a strategy inspired by 2D incremental methods [1, 43, 54] and
recently extended to 3D settings [4], to mitigate forgetting by storing a small set of repre-
sentative samples from earlier phases. However, ER alone is insufficient to achieve robust
performance. To address this, two additional components are introduced: aPseudo-Label
Generator(PLG), which leverages a frozen model to generate supervision signals for previ-
ously seen classes, and aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) module that compensates for
class imbalance across phases. Each of these components is described in detail below 1. Exemplar Replay (ER).Inspired by Buzzega et al. [5], ER addresses the issue of catas-
trophic forgetting by allowing the model to retain a subset of data from earlier phases. During phaset, the model is trained not only on the current task dataD t , but also on a
set of exemplarsE 1:t−1, collected from previous phases. These exemplars are accumulated
incrementally:E 1:t−1 =E 1 ∪···∪E t−1 .Here,E t denotes the exemplar subset stored after
phaset, and|E t |denotes the exemplar replay size. The combined replay dataset is denoted
as:D t
ER =D t ∪E 1:t−1.Epoch training consists of two stages: first, the model is trained on
the current data,D t ; then it is trained using exemplars fromE 1:t−1. While previous CI-3DIS approaches rely on large exemplar sets to mitigate forgetting [4],
such strategies become impractical under memory constraints. Consequently, although ER
aids knowledge retention, it is insufficient on its own for robust performance with a limited
exemplar budget. Therefore, PLG and CBR are introduced to better preserve past represen-
tations and enhance generalisation across phases. Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG).In the CI-3DIS setting, during phaset(wheret>1),
although ground-truth labels for previously seen classes are unavailable, the model from the
previous phaseΦ t−1 , which preserves knowledge of past tasks, is retained. We use this
model to generate pseudo-labels for previously seen classes, thereby providing approximate
supervision during training. This allows the current modelΦt , to retain prior knowledge and
reduce forgetting, even without access to ground-truth annotations. Given a point cloud and label pair(P,Y t ), fromD t , the previous modelΦ t−1 , generates
pseudo-labels for the previously seen classes as ˆY1:t−1 =Φ t−1 (P), which we denote as ˜Yt
1For clarity, modifications introduced by each component (ER, PLG, and CBR) are highlighted in green, blue,
and red, respectively. 6THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D
for brevity. However, we observe that utilising all predictions fromΦt−1 introduces noisy or
incorrect labels, which degrade overall performance. To mitigate this, we select the top-K
most confident instance predictions, denoted as ˜Yt
K, and concatenate them with the ground-
truth labels of the current task to obtain the supervision set: ¯Yt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt
K. Following this,
the loss is computed over both the current task’s ground-truth labels and the top-Kconfi-
dent pseudo-labels from earlier phases, enabling the model to retain prior knowledge while
adapting to new classes. Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR).While ER and PLG contribute to preserving prior
knowledge, we observe that the model’s predictions are biased towards frequent classes,
resulting in the forgetting of rare categories. This issue is further amplified by the top-K
pseudo-labels selected by PLG, which predominantly represent dominant classes in the data. To address this, we propose aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) scheme that compensates
for class imbalance using object frequency statistics. At taskt, only the current datasetD t
and its label distributionp t (c)over classesc∈ Ct are available. Datasets and class distribu-
tions from earlier tasks{D i,p i(c)}t−1
i=1 are no longer accessible, which makes it challenging
to directly account for class imbalance across all previously seen tasks. Therefore, we pro-
pose to leverage the pseudo-label predictions of the frozen modelΦ t−1 as a proxy for the
class distribution across previously learned categories. During each training iteration, the previous modelΦ t−1 is applied to the current inputP
to generate pseudo-labels ˜Yt , from which we accumulate class-wise frequency statistics for
previously learned classes. LetC1:t = St
i=1 Ci represent the union of all classes seen up to task
t. At the end of each epoch, we compute the overall class frequencyf∈R |C1:t | by combining
the pseudo-label distribution ˜pt (c)derived from ˜Yt with the ground-truth label distribution
pt (c)from the current task. The resulting frequency vectorf= [f(c)] c∈C1:t is then used to
compute class-wise weightsw= [w(c)] c∈C1:t , which guide balanced pseudo-label selection
and help the model focus on rare classes. In the next epoch, the modelΦ t−1 produces soft pseudo-label predictions ˜Yt (as de-
scribed in PLG) , where each component ˜Yt [c]denotes the confidence score for classc∈
C1:t−1. To promote balanced pseudo-label selection, class-wise re-weighting is applied using
w(c) = 1
f(c)+ε , whereεis a small constant for numerical stability. The adjusted predictions
are computed by applying the class-wise weights as: ˜Yt,w [c] =w(c)· ˜Yt [c],∀c∈ C 1:t−1. Top-Kselection is then applied to both the original and the re-weighted scores, yielding
two pseudo-label sets: ˜Yt
K and ˜Yt,w
K , respectively. The final augmented target set, Yt , is
constructed by concatenating the ground-truth labelsY t with both sets of pseudo-labels:
Yt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt
K ∥ ˜Yt,w
K .(2)
Although the above re-weighting mitigates bias from prior tasks, it does not address class
imbalance within the current taskt. To resolve this, the class-balanced weightsw c are ex-
tended to incorporate statistics from both previously seen and current classes, i.e., overC 1:t
rather than onlyC 1:t−1. The updated weights, denoted asw ′
c, are used to re-weights both
pseudo-label selection and classification loss, ensuring balanced supervision across all seen
categories, including rare ones. This unified strategy reduces bias and enhances performance
across phases. The pseudo-code for constructing the supervision set in Eq. (2), which incor-
porates both PLG and CBR components, is provided in Appendix A. Final Objective.The final training objective ofCLIMB-3D, incorporating ER, PLG, and THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D7

While CI-3DIS methods offer a wide range of practical applications, they frequently rely
on the assumption of uniform sample distribution, which rarely holds in real-world settings. In practice, the number of object categories, denoted byC, is often large and characterised
by substantial variability in category frequency, shape, structure, and size. To address these
challenges, we propose three incremental learning scenarios, each designed to capture a
different facet of real-world complexity. The design of these scenarios is detailed below; for
further information and illustrations, refer to Appendix E of the supplementary material. Split-A: Frequency Scenarios.This scenario acknowledges that datasets are often la-
belled based on the frequency of categories. To accommodate this, we propose a split where
the model learns from the most frequent categories and subsequently incorporates the less
frequent ones in later stages. By prioritising the training of frequently occurring categories,
the model can establish a strong foundation before expanding to handle rare categories. Split-B: Semantic Scenarios.Beyond frequency, semantic similarity is crucial in real-
world deployments. While objects often share visual or functional traits, models may en-
counter semantically different categories in new environments. To simulate this challenge,
we introduce theSplit-Bscenario. Here, categories are grouped based on their semantic
relationships, and the model is incrementally trained on one semantic group at a time. This
setup encourages the model to generalise across semantically similar categories and adapt
more effectively when exposed to new ones. Unlike theSplit-Ascenario, which organises
learning based on category frequency, theSplit-Bscenario may contain both frequent and
infrequent categories within a single task, focusing on semantic continuity and transfer. Split-C: Random Scenarios.In some cases, data labelling is driven by the availability of
objects rather than predefined criteria. To capture this, we introduce theSplit-Cscenario,
which represents a fully random setting where any class can appear in any task, resulting in
varying levels of class imbalance. By exposing the model to such diverse and unpredictable
distributions, we aim to improve its robustness in real-world situations where labelled data
availability is inconsistent. These incremental scenarios are designed to provide a more realistic representation of
object distributions, frequencies, and dynamics encountered in the real world. 4 Experiments

assessing real-world scenarios. In addition, we compare our approach against existing in-
cremental learning methods using ScanNetV2 [16] in the 3DSS setting. For this evaluation,
we follow the standard training and validation splits defined in prior works [74] to ensure
consistency with existing methods. Evaluation Metrics.We evaluate our method usingMean Average Precision(mAP), a
standard metric for 3DIS which provides a comprehensive measure of segmentation quality
by accounting for both precision and recall. For comparison with existing 3DSS methods,
we report themean Intersection over Union(mIoU), which quantifies the overlap between
predicted and ground truth segments. To assess the model’s ability to mitigate catastrophic
forgetting in incremental settings, we use theForgetting Percentage Points(FPP) metric, as
defined in [47]. FPP captures performance degradation by measuring the accuracy drop on
the initially seen categories between the first and final training phases. Detailed descriptions of the incremental scenarios (Split-A,Split-B,Split-C) and im-
plementation are provided in Appendix B. 4.2 Results and Discussion

To evaluate our proposed approach, we construct a baseline using ER [5] for the 3DIS
setting, as no existing incremental baselines are available for this task. In contrast, for the
3DSS setting, where incremental baselines do exist, we compare our method against three
prior approaches [43, 60, 74]. Results on CI-3DIS.Tab. 1 compares CLIMB-3D against the ER baseline across the three
CI-3DIS scenarios, evaluated after all phases using mAP 25, mAP50, overall mAP, and FPP. In theSplit-Ascenario, characterised by significant distribution shifts, our method achieves
gains of +19.23%, +16.76%, and +12.28% in mAP 25, mAP 50, and overall mAP, respec-
tively, while drastically reducing forgetting with FPP scores of 3.44% (mAP 25) and 2.63%
(mAP50), both over 45 points lower than the baseline. Under theSplit-Bscenario, with
semantically related new categories, improvements of +18.26%, +16.49%, and +12.76%
are observed alongside a reduction in forgetting to 8.00% and 5.51% from baseline levels
above 42%. For theSplit-Cscenario, featuring increasing geometric complexity, CLIMB-
3D maintains solid gains of +5.94%, +5.70%, and +4.08% across mAP metrics, with forget-
ting reduced by over 22 points. Overall, these results demonstrate robust forward transfer,
minimal forgetting, and stable learning, highlighting the method’s effectiveness for scalable
continual 3D semantic understanding. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D9

Results on CI-3DSS.Although our primary focus is on CI-3DIS, we also evaluate our
method under the CI-3DSS setting to enable comparisons with existing approaches. To do
so, we adapt our predictions to assign each point the label corresponding to the highest-
confidence mask and exclude background classes (e.g., floor and wall), as these are not part
of the semantic segmentation targets. Tab. 2 presents a comparison between our method and
existing baselines on the ScanNet V2 dataset [16], evaluated using mIoU across two training
phases and overall. Although originally designed for instance segmentation, our method
generalises effectively to semantic segmentation, achieving substantial gains of +35.23%
mIoU in Phase 1 and +19.1% in Phase 2. Overall, it achieves 59.38% mIoU, significantly
higher than the∼30% mIoU of prior methods, highlighting its robustness and transferability. Refer to Appendix C, D, and F of the supplementary material for detailed analyses of per-
phase performance, rare-class evaluation, and qualitative result comparisons, respectively. 4.3 Ablation

We conduct an ablation study to evaluate the contribution of each component in our
framework. As an upper bound, we report the performance of anOraclemodel, which is
trained jointly on the full dataset. For the incremental setting, we follow the previously
defined splits and first train the model naively across phases. We then incrementally add
each module to isolate its impact. Tab. 3 presents results for theSplit-Ascenario using both
mAP50 and FPP metrics. Naïve Training.When trained naïvely without any dedicated modules, the model suffers
from severe catastrophic forgetting, as evident in row 2. The model entirely forgets pre-
viously learned classes upon entering new phases, with performance dropping to zero for
earlier splits and FPP rising to 56.82. 10THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D
Effect of ER.Adding exemplar replay (row 3) partially alleviates forgetting by maintaining
a buffer of past examples. This yields notable gains fors1in Phase 2 (+18.51%) and Phase 3
(+10.38%), and also improvess2in Phase 3 (+9.43%). However, the overall forgetting
remains substantial (FPP: 46.44), showing ER alone is insufficient. Effect of PLG.The addition of the pseudo-label generator (PLG), which generates labels for
previous classes by retaining a copy of the model from an earlier phase, facilitates knowledge
retention and forward transfer. As shown in row 4, PLG significantly reduces forgetting and
enhances performance on current tasks. Fors1, it improves mAP 50 by 31.49% in Phase 2
and 39.40% in Phase 3 over exemplar replay. Overall, PLG yields a 15.00% increase in
performance and reduces forgetting by 39.40%. Effect of CBR.Finally, class-balanced re-weighting (CBR) mitigates class imbalance dur-
ing both pseudo-labelling and current task learning by adjusting each class’s contribution
based on its frequency. As shown in row 5, CBR enhancess1retention over PLG in Phases 2
and 3 (+4.67% and +4.41%), and further improves performance ons2ands3. It also achieves
the lowest FPP of 2.63, reflecting strong forgetting mitigation. Overall, CBR offers the best
trade-off between retaining past knowledge and acquiring new tasks, outperforming PLG
and ER by 4.41% and 43.81%, respectively. 4.4 Limitations & Future Work
While CLIMB-3D achieves strong performance across CI-3DIS and CI-3DSS settings, sev-
eral limitations remain and warrant discussion. The experiments are currently limited to
indoor datasets (ScanNet200 and ScanNetV2), therefore evaluating performance on outdoor
scenes would help assess generalisability across diverse environments. The current setup
also considers only three incremental phases, whereas real-world applications often involve
longer sequences; incorporating such extended setups would better reflect practical chal-
lenges. Moreover, the model operates in a uni-modal setting. Integrating multi-modal cues,
such as vision-language models, could further enhance performance, as suggested by recent
2D and 3D studies [25, 65, 66]. 5 Conclusion
This work addresses the challenge of catastrophic forgetting in class-incremental 3D in-
stance segmentation by introducing a modular framework that integrates exemplar replay
(ER), a pseudo-label generator (PLG), and class-balanced re-weighting (CBR). The pro-
posed method incrementally adapts to new classes while preserving prior knowledge, all
without requiring access to the full dataset. Extensive experiments on a three-phase bench-
mark validate the individual and combined effectiveness of each component: ER enables
efficient memory-based retention; PLG facilitates knowledge preservation through pseudo-
supervision; and CBR mitigates class imbalance to enhance learning stability. Together,
these components significantly reduce forgetting and improve segmentation performance
across all phases. By achieving a strong balance between stability and plasticity, our ap-
proach advances continual 3D scene understanding and sets a new baseline for future re-
search in this area. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D11

1 Introduction
Table Chair Couch Pillow Coffee Table Sofa Chair Recycling BinCabinet Unknown
Task-1 Task-2 Task-3
Figure 1:Overview of the CI-3DIS setting.New object categories are introduced incre-
mentally with each task. After every phase, the model must recognise both newly added
and previously learned classes. For instance, in Task 2, categories such asPillow,Coffee
Table, andSofa Chairare introduced, while the model is expected to retain recognition
of earlier classes likeTable,Chair, andCouch. 3D instance segmentation (3DIS) is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves
identifying precise object boundaries and class labels in 3D space, with broad applications in
graphics, robotics, and augmented reality [4, 39]. Traditional 3DIS methods, including top-
down [28, 70, 78], bottom-up [26, 73], and transformer-based approaches [59], perform well
under the assumption that all classes are available and balanced during training. However,
this assumption does not hold in real-world environments, where new object classes emerge
over time and exhibit natural imbalance. This gap motivates the need for Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) [17, 54], which sup-
ports learning new categories while retaining knowledge of previous ones [51]. While CIL
has seen success in 2D image tasks [1, 43, 54, 60], extensions to 3D point clouds remain
limited, often focusing on object-level classification [13, 18, 48]. Recent works on scene-
level class-incremental 3DIS (CI-3DIS) [4] and class-incremental semantic segmentation
(CI-3DSS) [74] show promise, but depend heavily on large exemplar [56] and overlook class
imbalance, limiting their practicality. To address this, we proposeCLIMB-3D, a unified framework forCLass-incremental
IMBalance-aware3DIS that jointly tackles catastrophic forgetting and class imbalance. The
framework begins with Exemplar Replay (ER), storing a small number of samples from
past classes for later replay. However, this alone does not yield promising results under the
strict memory constraints required in CI-3DIS. To address this, we introduce a Pseudo-Label
Generator (PLG), which uses a frozen model from previous task to generate supervision for
earlier classes. However, we observed that PLG tends to favour frequent classes while ig-
noring under-represented ones. To mitigate this, we propose a Class-Balanced Re-weighting
(CBR), which estimates class frequencies from the pseudo-labels to enhance the learning of
rare classes without accessing past data. Together, these components form a practical and
effective solution for real-world 3DIS. To evaluate CLIMB-3D, we designed three benchmark scenarios for CI-3DIS based on
the ScanNet200 dataset [57]. These scenarios simulate incremental learning setup under nat-
ural class imbalance, where new classes emerge based on (A) object frequency, (B) semantic
similarity, or (C) random grouping. Additionally, for comparison with existing methods,
we evaluate our approach on CI-3DSS using the ScanNetV2 dataset [16]. Experimental re-
sults show that our method significantly reduces forgetting and improves performance across
both frequent and rare categories, outperforming previous methods in both settings. Fig. 1
illustrates the CI-3DIS setup. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D3
In summary, our contributions are: (i) a novel problem setting of imbalanced class-
incremental 3DIS with an effective method to balance learning and mitigate forgetting; (ii)
three benchmarks modelling continual object emergence with natural imbalance; and (iii)
strong experimental results, achieving up to 16.76% mAP improvement over baselines. 2 Related Work
3D Instance Segmentation.Various methods have been proposed for 3DIS. Grouping-
based approaches adopt a bottom-up pipeline that learns latent embeddings for point cluster-
ing [9, 21, 22, 29, 37, 44, 70, 78]. In contrast, proposal-based methods follow a top-down
strategy by detecting 3D boxes and segmenting objects within them [19, 26, 46, 73, 76]. Recently, transformer-based models [68] have also been applied to 3DIS and 3DSS [59, 64],
inspired by advances in 2D vision [10, 11]. However, these approaches require full anno-
tations for all classes and are not designed for progressive learning, where only new class
annotations are available and previous data is inaccessible. Another line of work aims to re-
duce annotation costs by proposing weakly supervised 3DIS methods based on sparse cues
[12, 27, 72]. While effective with limited annotations, these methods assume a fixed set of
classes and are susceptible to catastrophic forgetting in incremental settings. Incremental Learning.Continual learning involves training models sequentially to miti-
gate catastrophic forgetting. One common strategy is model regularisation, which constrains
parameter updates using techniques such as elastic weight consolidation or knowledge dis-
tillation [1, 24, 35, 43, 60]. Another approach is exemplar replay, where past data is stored
or generated to rehearse older tasks while learning new ones [5, 7, 30, 54]. A third direc-
tion involves dynamically expanding the model architecture or using modular sub-networks
to accommodate new tasks without interfering with old ones [31, 42, 53, 58, 71, 79]. Re-
cent efforts in class-incremental 3D segmentation [63, 74] have shown early promise but
often rely on basic architectures and focus primarily on semantic segmentation. Other works
[4, 36] explore continual learning in 3D settings, though they often depend on large memory
buffers. In contrast, our work introduces a tailored framework for 3D instance segmentation
that effectively transfers knowledge across tasks, even under class imbalance. Long-tailed Recognition.Imbalanced class distributions lead to poor recognition of rare
(long-tail) classes. To address this, re-sampling methods balance the data via input [8, 20, 50,
52, 61] or feature space [3, 14, 40], avoiding naïve under-/over-sampling. Loss re-weighting
offers another direction, using class-based [6, 15, 23, 32, 33, 69] or per-example [45, 55, 62]
adjustments to ensure fair contribution. Parameter regularisation improves generalisation
through weight constraints [2], albeit requiring careful tuning. Other approaches leverage
transfer learning [77, 81], self-supervision [41, 75], or contrastive learning [34, 41, 82] to
improve rare-class representations. Long-tailed recognition is well-studied in 2D with large-
scale datasets [15, 49, 67]; in 3D, ScanNet200 [16, 57] enables similar efforts. Prior 3D
work focused on re-weighting, re-sampling, and transfer learning [57], while regularisation
remains underexplored. CeCo [80] balances class centres via auxiliary loss but overlooks
sampling and augmentation. Lahoud et al. [38] propose adaptive classifier regularisation
for 3D segmentation, outperforming prior approaches without threshold tuning. However,
neither method considers incremental learning. In contrast, we jointly address long-tail and
continual 3D semantic segmentation. 4THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D

Figure 2: Overview ofCLIMB-3Dfor CI-3DIS. The model incrementally learns new classes
across sequential phases. During taskt, point cloudsPand their corresponding labelsY t are
sampled from a combination of the current training datasetD t and Exemplar Replay (ER),
which maintains a small memory of past examples. These are then passed to the current
modelΦ t to produce predicted labelsY t . The Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG) selects the
top-Kpredictions from the previous modelΦ t−1 . These pseudo-labels are then weighted
based on class frequencyf(c)using Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR), and the top-Kre-
weighted labels are selected to form the balanced pseudo-label set ¯Yt . This pseudo-label set
is then concatenated with the ground-truth labels to form a final augmented supervision set
Yt for taskt, which is used to optimise the modelΦ t using Eq. (3). 3 Methodology
3.1 Problem Formulation
3DIS.The objective of this task is to detect and segment each object instance within a point
cloud. Formally, the training dataset is denoted asD={(P i,Yi)}N
i=1, whereNis the number
of training samples. Each inputP i ∈R M×6 is a coloured point cloud consisting ofMpoints,
where each point is represented by its 3D coordinates and RGB values. The corresponding
annotationY i ={(m i,j ,ci,j )}Ji
j=1 containsJ i object instances, wheremi,j ∈ {0,1}M is a binary
mask indicating which points belong to thej-th instance, andc i,j ∈ C={1,...,C}is the
semantic class label of that instance. GivenP i, the modelΦpredicts instance-level outputs
ˆYi ={(ˆmi,j ,ˆci,j )}
ˆJi
j=1, where ˆmi,j and ˆci,j denote the predicted mask and category label for
thej-th instance, respectively. The number of predicted instances ˆJi varies depending on the
model’s inference. The model is optimised using the following objective:

whereL cls andL mask are the average classification and mask losses over all instances, andλ
controls their trade-off. CI-3DIS.Unlike conventional 3DIS, CI-3DIS involves sequential learning, where object
categories are introduced incrementally overTtraining tasks. Each tasktintroduces a dis-
joint set of classesC t , withC= ST

Overview.As shown in Fig. 2 and formulated in Sec. 3.1, the proposed framework for
CI-3DIS follows aphase-wisetraining strategy. In each phase, the model is exposed to a
carefully curated subset of the dataset, simulating real-world scenarios discussed in Sec. 3.3. Training naïvely on such phased data leads tocatastrophic forgetting[51], where the model
forgets prior knowledge when learning new tasks. To address this, we first incorporateEx-
emplar Replay(ER) [5], a strategy inspired by 2D incremental methods [1, 43, 54] and
recently extended to 3D settings [4], to mitigate forgetting by storing a small set of repre-
sentative samples from earlier phases. However, ER alone is insufficient to achieve robust
performance. To address this, two additional components are introduced: aPseudo-Label
Generator(PLG), which leverages a frozen model to generate supervision signals for previ-
ously seen classes, and aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) module that compensates for
class imbalance across phases. Each of these components is described in detail below 1. Exemplar Replay (ER).Inspired by Buzzega et al. [5], ER addresses the issue of catas-
trophic forgetting by allowing the model to retain a subset of data from earlier phases. During phaset, the model is trained not only on the current task dataD t , but also on a
set of exemplarsE 1:t−1, collected from previous phases. These exemplars are accumulated
incrementally:E 1:t−1 =E 1 ∪···∪E t−1 .Here,E t denotes the exemplar subset stored after
phaset, and|E t |denotes the exemplar replay size. The combined replay dataset is denoted
as:D t
ER =D t ∪E 1:t−1.Epoch training consists of two stages: first, the model is trained on
the current data,D t ; then it is trained using exemplars fromE 1:t−1. While previous CI-3DIS approaches rely on large exemplar sets to mitigate forgetting [4],
such strategies become impractical under memory constraints. Consequently, although ER
aids knowledge retention, it is insufficient on its own for robust performance with a limited
exemplar budget. Therefore, PLG and CBR are introduced to better preserve past represen-
tations and enhance generalisation across phases. Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG).In the CI-3DIS setting, during phaset(wheret>1),
although ground-truth labels for previously seen classes are unavailable, the model from the
previous phaseΦ t−1 , which preserves knowledge of past tasks, is retained. We use this
model to generate pseudo-labels for previously seen classes, thereby providing approximate
supervision during training. This allows the current modelΦt , to retain prior knowledge and
reduce forgetting, even without access to ground-truth annotations. Given a point cloud and label pair(P,Y t ), fromD t , the previous modelΦ t−1 , generates
pseudo-labels for the previously seen classes as ˆY1:t−1 =Φ t−1 (P), which we denote as ˜Yt
1For clarity, modifications introduced by each component (ER, PLG, and CBR) are highlighted in green, blue,
and red, respectively. 6THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D
for brevity. However, we observe that utilising all predictions fromΦt−1 introduces noisy or
incorrect labels, which degrade overall performance. To mitigate this, we select the top-K
most confident instance predictions, denoted as ˜Yt
K, and concatenate them with the ground-
truth labels of the current task to obtain the supervision set: ¯Yt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt
K. Following this,
the loss is computed over both the current task’s ground-truth labels and the top-Kconfi-
dent pseudo-labels from earlier phases, enabling the model to retain prior knowledge while
adapting to new classes. Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR).While ER and PLG contribute to preserving prior
knowledge, we observe that the model’s predictions are biased towards frequent classes,
resulting in the forgetting of rare categories. This issue is further amplified by the top-K
pseudo-labels selected by PLG, which predominantly represent dominant classes in the data. To address this, we propose aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) scheme that compensates
for class imbalance using object frequency statistics. At taskt, only the current datasetD t
and its label distributionp t (c)over classesc∈ Ct are available. Datasets and class distribu-
tions from earlier tasks{D i,p i(c)}t−1
i=1 are no longer accessible, which makes it challenging
to directly account for class imbalance across all previously seen tasks. Therefore, we pro-
pose to leverage the pseudo-label predictions of the frozen modelΦ t−1 as a proxy for the
class distribution across previously learned categories. During each training iteration, the previous modelΦ t−1 is applied to the current inputP
to generate pseudo-labels ˜Yt , from which we accumulate class-wise frequency statistics for
previously learned classes. LetC1:t = St
i=1 Ci represent the union of all classes seen up to task
t. At the end of each epoch, we compute the overall class frequencyf∈R |C1:t | by combining
the pseudo-label distribution ˜pt (c)derived from ˜Yt with the ground-truth label distribution
pt (c)from the current task. The resulting frequency vectorf= [f(c)] c∈C1:t is then used to
compute class-wise weightsw= [w(c)] c∈C1:t , which guide balanced pseudo-label selection
and help the model focus on rare classes. In the next epoch, the modelΦ t−1 produces soft pseudo-label predictions ˜Yt (as de-
scribed in PLG) , where each component ˜Yt [c]denotes the confidence score for classc∈
C1:t−1. To promote balanced pseudo-label selection, class-wise re-weighting is applied using
w(c) = 1
f(c)+ε , whereεis a small constant for numerical stability. The adjusted predictions
are computed by applying the class-wise weights as: ˜Yt,w [c] =w(c)· ˜Yt [c],∀c∈ C 1:t−1. Top-Kselection is then applied to both the original and the re-weighted scores, yielding
two pseudo-label sets: ˜Yt
K and ˜Yt,w
K , respectively. The final augmented target set, Yt , is
constructed by concatenating the ground-truth labelsY t with both sets of pseudo-labels:
Yt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt
K ∥ ˜Yt,w
K .(2)
Although the above re-weighting mitigates bias from prior tasks, it does not address class
imbalance within the current taskt. To resolve this, the class-balanced weightsw c are ex-
tended to incorporate statistics from both previously seen and current classes, i.e., overC 1:t
rather than onlyC 1:t−1. The updated weights, denoted asw ′
c, are used to re-weights both
pseudo-label selection and classification loss, ensuring balanced supervision across all seen
categories, including rare ones. This unified strategy reduces bias and enhances performance
across phases. The pseudo-code for constructing the supervision set in Eq. (2), which incor-
porates both PLG and CBR components, is provided in Appendix A. Final Objective.The final training objective ofCLIMB-3D, incorporating ER, PLG, and THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D7

While CI-3DIS methods offer a wide range of practical applications, they frequently rely
on the assumption of uniform sample distribution, which rarely holds in real-world settings. In practice, the number of object categories, denoted byC, is often large and characterised
by substantial variability in category frequency, shape, structure, and size. To address these
challenges, we propose three incremental learning scenarios, each designed to capture a
different facet of real-world complexity. The design of these scenarios is detailed below; for
further information and illustrations, refer to Appendix E of the supplementary material. Split-A: Frequency Scenarios.This scenario acknowledges that datasets are often la-
belled based on the frequency of categories. To accommodate this, we propose a split where
the model learns from the most frequent categories and subsequently incorporates the less
frequent ones in later stages. By prioritising the training of frequently occurring categories,
the model can establish a strong foundation before expanding to handle rare categories. Split-B: Semantic Scenarios.Beyond frequency, semantic similarity is crucial in real-
world deployments. While objects often share visual or functional traits, models may en-
counter semantically different categories in new environments. To simulate this challenge,
we introduce theSplit-Bscenario. Here, categories are grouped based on their semantic
relationships, and the model is incrementally trained on one semantic group at a time. This
setup encourages the model to generalise across semantically similar categories and adapt
more effectively when exposed to new ones. Unlike theSplit-Ascenario, which organises
learning based on category frequency, theSplit-Bscenario may contain both frequent and
infrequent categories within a single task, focusing on semantic continuity and transfer. Split-C: Random Scenarios.In some cases, data labelling is driven by the availability of
objects rather than predefined criteria. To capture this, we introduce theSplit-Cscenario,
which represents a fully random setting where any class can appear in any task, resulting in
varying levels of class imbalance. By exposing the model to such diverse and unpredictable
distributions, we aim to improve its robustness in real-world situations where labelled data
availability is inconsistent. These incremental scenarios are designed to provide a more realistic representation of
object distributions, frequencies, and dynamics encountered in the real world. 4 Experiments

assessing real-world scenarios. In addition, we compare our approach against existing in-
cremental learning methods using ScanNetV2 [16] in the 3DSS setting. For this evaluation,
we follow the standard training and validation splits defined in prior works [74] to ensure
consistency with existing methods. Evaluation Metrics.We evaluate our method usingMean Average Precision(mAP), a
standard metric for 3DIS which provides a comprehensive measure of segmentation quality
by accounting for both precision and recall. For comparison with existing 3DSS methods,
we report themean Intersection over Union(mIoU), which quantifies the overlap between
predicted and ground truth segments. To assess the model’s ability to mitigate catastrophic
forgetting in incremental settings, we use theForgetting Percentage Points(FPP) metric, as
defined in [47]. FPP captures performance degradation by measuring the accuracy drop on
the initially seen categories between the first and final training phases. Detailed descriptions of the incremental scenarios (Split-A,Split-B,Split-C) and im-
plementation are provided in Appendix B. 4.2 Results and Discussion

To evaluate our proposed approach, we construct a baseline using ER [5] for the 3DIS
setting, as no existing incremental baselines are available for this task. In contrast, for the
3DSS setting, where incremental baselines do exist, we compare our method against three
prior approaches [43, 60, 74]. Results on CI-3DIS.Tab. 1 compares CLIMB-3D against the ER baseline across the three
CI-3DIS scenarios, evaluated after all phases using mAP 25, mAP50, overall mAP, and FPP. In theSplit-Ascenario, characterised by significant distribution shifts, our method achieves
gains of +19.23%, +16.76%, and +12.28% in mAP 25, mAP 50, and overall mAP, respec-
tively, while drastically reducing forgetting with FPP scores of 3.44% (mAP 25) and 2.63%
(mAP50), both over 45 points lower than the baseline. Under theSplit-Bscenario, with
semantically related new categories, improvements of +18.26%, +16.49%, and +12.76%
are observed alongside a reduction in forgetting to 8.00% and 5.51% from baseline levels
above 42%. For theSplit-Cscenario, featuring increasing geometric complexity, CLIMB-
3D maintains solid gains of +5.94%, +5.70%, and +4.08% across mAP metrics, with forget-
ting reduced by over 22 points. Overall, these results demonstrate robust forward transfer,
minimal forgetting, and stable learning, highlighting the method’s effectiveness for scalable
continual 3D semantic understanding. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D9

Results on CI-3DSS.Although our primary focus is on CI-3DIS, we also evaluate our
method under the CI-3DSS setting to enable comparisons with existing approaches. To do
so, we adapt our predictions to assign each point the label corresponding to the highest-
confidence mask and exclude background classes (e.g., floor and wall), as these are not part
of the semantic segmentation targets. Tab. 2 presents a comparison between our method and
existing baselines on the ScanNet V2 dataset [16], evaluated using mIoU across two training
phases and overall. Although originally designed for instance segmentation, our method
generalises effectively to semantic segmentation, achieving substantial gains of +35.23%
mIoU in Phase 1 and +19.1% in Phase 2. Overall, it achieves 59.38% mIoU, significantly
higher than the∼30% mIoU of prior methods, highlighting its robustness and transferability. Refer to Appendix C, D, and F of the supplementary material for detailed analyses of per-
phase performance, rare-class evaluation, and qualitative result comparisons, respectively. 4.3 Ablation

We conduct an ablation study to evaluate the contribution of each component in our
framework. As an upper bound, we report the performance of anOraclemodel, which is
trained jointly on the full dataset. For the incremental setting, we follow the previously
defined splits and first train the model naively across phases. We then incrementally add
each module to isolate its impact. Tab. 3 presents results for theSplit-Ascenario using both
mAP50 and FPP metrics. Naïve Training.When trained naïvely without any dedicated modules, the model suffers
from severe catastrophic forgetting, as evident in row 2. The model entirely forgets pre-
viously learned classes upon entering new phases, with performance dropping to zero for
earlier splits and FPP rising to 56.82. 10THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D
Effect of ER.Adding exemplar replay (row 3) partially alleviates forgetting by maintaining
a buffer of past examples. This yields notable gains fors1in Phase 2 (+18.51%) and Phase 3
(+10.38%), and also improvess2in Phase 3 (+9.43%). However, the overall forgetting
remains substantial (FPP: 46.44), showing ER alone is insufficient. Effect of PLG.The addition of the pseudo-label generator (PLG), which generates labels for
previous classes by retaining a copy of the model from an earlier phase, facilitates knowledge
retention and forward transfer. As shown in row 4, PLG significantly reduces forgetting and
enhances performance on current tasks. Fors1, it improves mAP 50 by 31.49% in Phase 2
and 39.40% in Phase 3 over exemplar replay. Overall, PLG yields a 15.00% increase in
performance and reduces forgetting by 39.40%. Effect of CBR.Finally, class-balanced re-weighting (CBR) mitigates class imbalance dur-
ing both pseudo-labelling and current task learning by adjusting each class’s contribution
based on its frequency. As shown in row 5, CBR enhancess1retention over PLG in Phases 2
and 3 (+4.67% and +4.41%), and further improves performance ons2ands3. It also achieves
the lowest FPP of 2.63, reflecting strong forgetting mitigation. Overall, CBR offers the best
trade-off between retaining past knowledge and acquiring new tasks, outperforming PLG
and ER by 4.41% and 43.81%, respectively. 4.4 Limitations & Future Work
While CLIMB-3D achieves strong performance across CI-3DIS and CI-3DSS settings, sev-
eral limitations remain and warrant discussion. The experiments are currently limited to
indoor datasets (ScanNet200 and ScanNetV2), therefore evaluating performance on outdoor
scenes would help assess generalisability across diverse environments. The current setup
also considers only three incremental phases, whereas real-world applications often involve
longer sequences; incorporating such extended setups would better reflect practical chal-
lenges. Moreover, the model operates in a uni-modal setting. Integrating multi-modal cues,
such as vision-language models, could further enhance performance, as suggested by recent
2D and 3D studies [25, 65, 66]. 5 Conclusion
This work addresses the challenge of catastrophic forgetting in class-incremental 3D in-
stance segmentation by introducing a modular framework that integrates exemplar replay
(ER), a pseudo-label generator (PLG), and class-balanced re-weighting (CBR). The pro-
posed method incrementally adapts to new classes while preserving prior knowledge, all
without requiring access to the full dataset. Extensive experiments on a three-phase bench-
mark validate the individual and combined effectiveness of each component: ER enables
efficient memory-based retention; PLG facilitates knowledge preservation through pseudo-
supervision; and CBR mitigates class imbalance to enhance learning stability. Together,
these components significantly reduce forgetting and improve segmentation performance
across all phases. By achieving a strong balance between stability and plasticity, our ap-
proach advances continual 3D scene understanding and sets a new baseline for future re-
search in this area. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D11

1 Introduction
Table Chair Couch Pillow Coffee Table Sofa Chair Recycling BinCabinet Unknown
Task-1 Task-2 Task-3
Figure 1:Overview of the CI-3DIS setting.New object categories are introduced incre-
mentally with each task. After every phase, the model must recognise both newly added
and previously learned classes. For instance, in Task 2, categories such asPillow,Coffee
Table, andSofa Chairare introduced, while the model is expected to retain recognition
of earlier classes likeTable,Chair, andCouch. 3D instance segmentation (3DIS) is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves
identifying precise object boundaries and class labels in 3D space, with broad applications in
graphics, robotics, and augmented reality [4, 39]. Traditional 3DIS methods, including top-
down [28, 70, 78], bottom-up [26, 73], and transformer-based approaches [59], perform well
under the assumption that all classes are available and balanced during training. However,
this assumption does not hold in real-world environments, where new object classes emerge
over time and exhibit natural imbalance. This gap motivates the need for Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) [17, 54], which sup-
ports learning new categories while retaining knowledge of previous ones [51]. While CIL
has seen success in 2D image tasks [1, 43, 54, 60], extensions to 3D point clouds remain
limited, often focusing on object-level classification [13, 18, 48]. Recent works on scene-
level class-incremental 3DIS (CI-3DIS) [4] and class-incremental semantic segmentation
(CI-3DSS) [74] show promise, but depend heavily on large exemplar [56] and overlook class
imbalance, limiting their practicality. To address this, we proposeCLIMB-3D, a unified framework forCLass-incremental
IMBalance-aware3DIS that jointly tackles catastrophic forgetting and class imbalance. The
framework begins with Exemplar Replay (ER), storing a small number of samples from
past classes for later replay. However, this alone does not yield promising results under the
strict memory constraints required in CI-3DIS. To address this, we introduce a Pseudo-Label
Generator (PLG), which uses a frozen model from previous task to generate supervision for
earlier classes. However, we observed that PLG tends to favour frequent classes while ig-
noring under-represented ones. To mitigate this, we propose a Class-Balanced Re-weighting
(CBR), which estimates class frequencies from the pseudo-labels to enhance the learning of
rare classes without accessing past data. Together, these components form a practical and
effective solution for real-world 3DIS. To evaluate CLIMB-3D, we designed three benchmark scenarios for CI-3DIS based on
the ScanNet200 dataset [57]. These scenarios simulate incremental learning setup under nat-
ural class imbalance, where new classes emerge based on (A) object frequency, (B) semantic
similarity, or (C) random grouping. Additionally, for comparison with existing methods,
we evaluate our approach on CI-3DSS using the ScanNetV2 dataset [16]. Experimental re-
sults show that our method significantly reduces forgetting and improves performance across
both frequent and rare categories, outperforming previous methods in both settings. Fig. 1
illustrates the CI-3DIS setup. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D3
In summary, our contributions are: (i) a novel problem setting of imbalanced class-
incremental 3DIS with an effective method to balance learning and mitigate forgetting; (ii)
three benchmarks modelling continual object emergence with natural imbalance; and (iii)
strong experimental results, achieving up to 16.76% mAP improvement over baselines. 2 Related Work
3D Instance Segmentation.Various methods have been proposed for 3DIS. Grouping-
based approaches adopt a bottom-up pipeline that learns latent embeddings for point cluster-
ing [9, 21, 22, 29, 37, 44, 70, 78]. In contrast, proposal-based methods follow a top-down
strategy by detecting 3D boxes and segmenting objects within them [19, 26, 46, 73, 76]. Recently, transformer-based models [68] have also been applied to 3DIS and 3DSS [59, 64],
inspired by advances in 2D vision [10, 11]. However, these approaches require full anno-
tations for all classes and are not designed for progressive learning, where only new class
annotations are available and previous data is inaccessible. Another line of work aims to re-
duce annotation costs by proposing weakly supervised 3DIS methods based on sparse cues
[12, 27, 72]. While effective with limited annotations, these methods assume a fixed set of
classes and are susceptible to catastrophic forgetting in incremental settings. Incremental Learning.Continual learning involves training models sequentially to miti-
gate catastrophic forgetting. One common strategy is model regularisation, which constrains
parameter updates using techniques such as elastic weight consolidation or knowledge dis-
tillation [1, 24, 35, 43, 60]. Another approach is exemplar replay, where past data is stored
or generated to rehearse older tasks while learning new ones [5, 7, 30, 54]. A third direc-
tion involves dynamically expanding the model architecture or using modular sub-networks
to accommodate new tasks without interfering with old ones [31, 42, 53, 58, 71, 79]. Re-
cent efforts in class-incremental 3D segmentation [63, 74] have shown early promise but
often rely on basic architectures and focus primarily on semantic segmentation. Other works
[4, 36] explore continual learning in 3D settings, though they often depend on large memory
buffers. In contrast, our work introduces a tailored framework for 3D instance segmentation
that effectively transfers knowledge across tasks, even under class imbalance. Long-tailed Recognition.Imbalanced class distributions lead to poor recognition of rare
(long-tail) classes. To address this, re-sampling methods balance the data via input [8, 20, 50,
52, 61] or feature space [3, 14, 40], avoiding naïve under-/over-sampling. Loss re-weighting
offers another direction, using class-based [6, 15, 23, 32, 33, 69] or per-example [45, 55, 62]
adjustments to ensure fair contribution. Parameter regularisation improves generalisation
through weight constraints [2], albeit requiring careful tuning. Other approaches leverage
transfer learning [77, 81], self-supervision [41, 75], or contrastive learning [34, 41, 82] to
improve rare-class representations. Long-tailed recognition is well-studied in 2D with large-
scale datasets [15, 49, 67]; in 3D, ScanNet200 [16, 57] enables similar efforts. Prior 3D
work focused on re-weighting, re-sampling, and transfer learning [57], while regularisation
remains underexplored. CeCo [80] balances class centres via auxiliary loss but overlooks
sampling and augmentation. Lahoud et al. [38] propose adaptive classifier regularisation
for 3D segmentation, outperforming prior approaches without threshold tuning. However,
neither method considers incremental learning. In contrast, we jointly address long-tail and
continual 3D semantic segmentation. 4THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D

Figure 2: Overview ofCLIMB-3Dfor CI-3DIS. The model incrementally learns new classes
across sequential phases. During taskt, point cloudsPand their corresponding labelsY t are
sampled from a combination of the current training datasetD t and Exemplar Replay (ER),
which maintains a small memory of past examples. These are then passed to the current
modelΦ t to produce predicted labelsY t . The Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG) selects the
top-Kpredictions from the previous modelΦ t−1 . These pseudo-labels are then weighted
based on class frequencyf(c)using Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR), and the top-Kre-
weighted labels are selected to form the balanced pseudo-label set ¯Yt . This pseudo-label set
is then concatenated with the ground-truth labels to form a final augmented supervision set
Yt for taskt, which is used to optimise the modelΦ t using Eq. (3). 3 Methodology
3.1 Problem Formulation
3DIS.The objective of this task is to detect and segment each object instance within a point
cloud. Formally, the training dataset is denoted asD={(P i,Yi)}N
i=1, whereNis the number
of training samples. Each inputP i ∈R M×6 is a coloured point cloud consisting ofMpoints,
where each point is represented by its 3D coordinates and RGB values. The corresponding
annotationY i ={(m i,j ,ci,j )}Ji
j=1 containsJ i object instances, wheremi,j ∈ {0,1}M is a binary
mask indicating which points belong to thej-th instance, andc i,j ∈ C={1,...,C}is the
semantic class label of that instance. GivenP i, the modelΦpredicts instance-level outputs
ˆYi ={(ˆmi,j ,ˆci,j )}
ˆJi
j=1, where ˆmi,j and ˆci,j denote the predicted mask and category label for
thej-th instance, respectively. The number of predicted instances ˆJi varies depending on the
model’s inference. The model is optimised using the following objective:
L3DIS(D;Φ) = 1

whereL cls andL mask are the average classification and mask losses over all instances, andλ
controls their trade-off. CI-3DIS.Unlike conventional 3DIS, CI-3DIS involves sequential learning, where object
categories are introduced incrementally overTtraining tasks. Each tasktintroduces a dis-
joint set of classesC t , withC= ST

Overview.As shown in Fig. 2 and formulated in Sec. 3.1, the proposed framework for
CI-3DIS follows aphase-wisetraining strategy. In each phase, the model is exposed to a
carefully curated subset of the dataset, simulating real-world scenarios discussed in Sec. 3.3. Training naïvely on such phased data leads tocatastrophic forgetting[51], where the model
forgets prior knowledge when learning new tasks. To address this, we first incorporateEx-
emplar Replay(ER) [5], a strategy inspired by 2D incremental methods [1, 43, 54] and
recently extended to 3D settings [4], to mitigate forgetting by storing a small set of repre-
sentative samples from earlier phases. However, ER alone is insufficient to achieve robust
performance. To address this, two additional components are introduced: aPseudo-Label
Generator(PLG), which leverages a frozen model to generate supervision signals for previ-
ously seen classes, and aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) module that compensates for
class imbalance across phases. Each of these components is described in detail below 1. Exemplar Replay (ER).Inspired by Buzzega et al. [5], ER addresses the issue of catas-
trophic forgetting by allowing the model to retain a subset of data from earlier phases. During phaset, the model is trained not only on the current task dataD t , but also on a
set of exemplarsE 1:t−1, collected from previous phases. These exemplars are accumulated
incrementally:E 1:t−1 =E 1 ∪···∪E t−1 .Here,E t denotes the exemplar subset stored after
phaset, and|E t |denotes the exemplar replay size. The combined replay dataset is denoted
as:D t
ER =D t ∪E 1:t−1.Epoch training consists of two stages: first, the model is trained on
the current data,D t ; then it is trained using exemplars fromE 1:t−1. While previous CI-3DIS approaches rely on large exemplar sets to mitigate forgetting [4],
such strategies become impractical under memory constraints. Consequently, although ER
aids knowledge retention, it is insufficient on its own for robust performance with a limited
exemplar budget. Therefore, PLG and CBR are introduced to better preserve past represen-
tations and enhance generalisation across phases. Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG).In the CI-3DIS setting, during phaset(wheret>1),
although ground-truth labels for previously seen classes are unavailable, the model from the
previous phaseΦ t−1 , which preserves knowledge of past tasks, is retained. We use this
model to generate pseudo-labels for previously seen classes, thereby providing approximate
supervision during training. This allows the current modelΦt , to retain prior knowledge and
reduce forgetting, even without access to ground-truth annotations. Given a point cloud and label pair(P,Y t ), fromD t , the previous modelΦ t−1 , generates
pseudo-labels for the previously seen classes as ˆY1:t−1 =Φ t−1 (P), which we denote as ˜Yt
1For clarity, modifications introduced by each component (ER, PLG, and CBR) are highlighted in green, blue,
and red, respectively. 6THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D
for brevity. However, we observe that utilising all predictions fromΦt−1 introduces noisy or
incorrect labels, which degrade overall performance. To mitigate this, we select the top-K
most confident instance predictions, denoted as ˜Yt
K, and concatenate them with the ground-
truth labels of the current task to obtain the supervision set: ¯Yt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt
K. Following this,
the loss is computed over both the current task’s ground-truth labels and the top-Kconfi-
dent pseudo-labels from earlier phases, enabling the model to retain prior knowledge while
adapting to new classes. Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR).While ER and PLG contribute to preserving prior
knowledge, we observe that the model’s predictions are biased towards frequent classes,
resulting in the forgetting of rare categories. This issue is further amplified by the top-K
pseudo-labels selected by PLG, which predominantly represent dominant classes in the data. To address this, we propose aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) scheme that compensates
for class imbalance using object frequency statistics. At taskt, only the current datasetD t
and its label distributionp t (c)over classesc∈ Ct are available. Datasets and class distribu-
tions from earlier tasks{D i,p i(c)}t−1
i=1 are no longer accessible, which makes it challenging
to directly account for class imbalance across all previously seen tasks. Therefore, we pro-
pose to leverage the pseudo-label predictions of the frozen modelΦ t−1 as a proxy for the
class distribution across previously learned categories. During each training iteration, the previous modelΦ t−1 is applied to the current inputP
to generate pseudo-labels ˜Yt , from which we accumulate class-wise frequency statistics for
previously learned classes. LetC1:t = St
i=1 Ci represent the union of all classes seen up to task
t. At the end of each epoch, we compute the overall class frequencyf∈R |C1:t | by combining
the pseudo-label distribution ˜pt (c)derived from ˜Yt with the ground-truth label distribution
pt (c)from the current task. The resulting frequency vectorf= [f(c)] c∈C1:t is then used to
compute class-wise weightsw= [w(c)] c∈C1:t , which guide balanced pseudo-label selection
and help the model focus on rare classes. In the next epoch, the modelΦ t−1 produces soft pseudo-label predictions ˜Yt (as de-
scribed in PLG) , where each component ˜Yt [c]denotes the confidence score for classc∈
C1:t−1. To promote balanced pseudo-label selection, class-wise re-weighting is applied using
w(c) = 1
f(c)+ε , whereεis a small constant for numerical stability. The adjusted predictions
are computed by applying the class-wise weights as: ˜Yt,w [c] =w(c)· ˜Yt [c],∀c∈ C 1:t−1. Top-Kselection is then applied to both the original and the re-weighted scores, yielding
two pseudo-label sets: ˜Yt
K and ˜Yt,w
K , respectively. The final augmented target set, Yt , is
constructed by concatenating the ground-truth labelsY t with both sets of pseudo-labels:
Yt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt
K ∥ ˜Yt,w
K .(2)
Although the above re-weighting mitigates bias from prior tasks, it does not address class
imbalance within the current taskt. To resolve this, the class-balanced weightsw c are ex-
tended to incorporate statistics from both previously seen and current classes, i.e., overC 1:t
rather than onlyC 1:t−1. The updated weights, denoted asw ′
c, are used to re-weights both
pseudo-label selection and classification loss, ensuring balanced supervision across all seen
categories, including rare ones. This unified strategy reduces bias and enhances performance
across phases. The pseudo-code for constructing the supervision set in Eq. (2), which incor-
porates both PLG and CBR components, is provided in Appendix A. Final Objective.The final training objective ofCLIMB-3D, incorporating ER, PLG, and THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D7
CBR, is formulated in Eq. (1) as:

While CI-3DIS methods offer a wide range of practical applications, they frequently rely
on the assumption of uniform sample distribution, which rarely holds in real-world settings. In practice, the number of object categories, denoted byC, is often large and characterised
by substantial variability in category frequency, shape, structure, and size. To address these
challenges, we propose three incremental learning scenarios, each designed to capture a
different facet of real-world complexity. The design of these scenarios is detailed below; for
further information and illustrations, refer to Appendix E of the supplementary material. Split-A: Frequency Scenarios.This scenario acknowledges that datasets are often la-
belled based on the frequency of categories. To accommodate this, we propose a split where
the model learns from the most frequent categories and subsequently incorporates the less
frequent ones in later stages. By prioritising the training of frequently occurring categories,
the model can establish a strong foundation before expanding to handle rare categories. Split-B: Semantic Scenarios.Beyond frequency, semantic similarity is crucial in real-
world deployments. While objects often share visual or functional traits, models may en-
counter semantically different categories in new environments. To simulate this challenge,
we introduce theSplit-Bscenario. Here, categories are grouped based on their semantic
relationships, and the model is incrementally trained on one semantic group at a time. This
setup encourages the model to generalise across semantically similar categories and adapt
more effectively when exposed to new ones. Unlike theSplit-Ascenario, which organises
learning based on category frequency, theSplit-Bscenario may contain both frequent and
infrequent categories within a single task, focusing on semantic continuity and transfer. Split-C: Random Scenarios.In some cases, data labelling is driven by the availability of
objects rather than predefined criteria. To capture this, we introduce theSplit-Cscenario,
which represents a fully random setting where any class can appear in any task, resulting in
varying levels of class imbalance. By exposing the model to such diverse and unpredictable
distributions, we aim to improve its robustness in real-world situations where labelled data
availability is inconsistent. These incremental scenarios are designed to provide a more realistic representation of
object distributions, frequencies, and dynamics encountered in the real world. 4 Experiments

assessing real-world scenarios. In addition, we compare our approach against existing in-
cremental learning methods using ScanNetV2 [16] in the 3DSS setting. For this evaluation,
we follow the standard training and validation splits defined in prior works [74] to ensure
consistency with existing methods. Evaluation Metrics.We evaluate our method usingMean Average Precision(mAP), a
standard metric for 3DIS which provides a comprehensive measure of segmentation quality
by accounting for both precision and recall. For comparison with existing 3DSS methods,
we report themean Intersection over Union(mIoU), which quantifies the overlap between
predicted and ground truth segments. To assess the model’s ability to mitigate catastrophic
forgetting in incremental settings, we use theForgetting Percentage Points(FPP) metric, as
defined in [47]. FPP captures performance degradation by measuring the accuracy drop on
the initially seen categories between the first and final training phases. Detailed descriptions of the incremental scenarios (Split-A,Split-B,Split-C) and im-
plementation are provided in Appendix B. 4.2 Results and Discussion

To evaluate our proposed approach, we construct a baseline using ER [5] for the 3DIS
setting, as no existing incremental baselines are available for this task. In contrast, for the
3DSS setting, where incremental baselines do exist, we compare our method against three
prior approaches [43, 60, 74]. Results on CI-3DIS.Tab. 1 compares CLIMB-3D against the ER baseline across the three
CI-3DIS scenarios, evaluated after all phases using mAP 25, mAP50, overall mAP, and FPP. In theSplit-Ascenario, characterised by significant distribution shifts, our method achieves
gains of +19.23%, +16.76%, and +12.28% in mAP 25, mAP 50, and overall mAP, respec-
tively, while drastically reducing forgetting with FPP scores of 3.44% (mAP 25) and 2.63%
(mAP50), both over 45 points lower than the baseline. Under theSplit-Bscenario, with
semantically related new categories, improvements of +18.26%, +16.49%, and +12.76%
are observed alongside a reduction in forgetting to 8.00% and 5.51% from baseline levels
above 42%. For theSplit-Cscenario, featuring increasing geometric complexity, CLIMB-
3D maintains solid gains of +5.94%, +5.70%, and +4.08% across mAP metrics, with forget-
ting reduced by over 22 points. Overall, these results demonstrate robust forward transfer,
minimal forgetting, and stable learning, highlighting the method’s effectiveness for scalable
continual 3D semantic understanding. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D9

Results on CI-3DSS.Although our primary focus is on CI-3DIS, we also evaluate our
method under the CI-3DSS setting to enable comparisons with existing approaches. To do
so, we adapt our predictions to assign each point the label corresponding to the highest-
confidence mask and exclude background classes (e.g., floor and wall), as these are not part
of the semantic segmentation targets. Tab. 2 presents a comparison between our method and
existing baselines on the ScanNet V2 dataset [16], evaluated using mIoU across two training
phases and overall. Although originally designed for instance segmentation, our method
generalises effectively to semantic segmentation, achieving substantial gains of +35.23%
mIoU in Phase 1 and +19.1% in Phase 2. Overall, it achieves 59.38% mIoU, significantly
higher than the∼30% mIoU of prior methods, highlighting its robustness and transferability. Refer to Appendix C, D, and F of the supplementary material for detailed analyses of per-
phase performance, rare-class evaluation, and qualitative result comparisons, respectively. 4.3 Ablation

We conduct an ablation study to evaluate the contribution of each component in our
framework. As an upper bound, we report the performance of anOraclemodel, which is
trained jointly on the full dataset. For the incremental setting, we follow the previously
defined splits and first train the model naively across phases. We then incrementally add
each module to isolate its impact. Tab. 3 presents results for theSplit-Ascenario using both
mAP50 and FPP metrics. Naïve Training.When trained naïvely without any dedicated modules, the model suffers
from severe catastrophic forgetting, as evident in row 2. The model entirely forgets pre-
viously learned classes upon entering new phases, with performance dropping to zero for
earlier splits and FPP rising to 56.82. 10THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D
Effect of ER.Adding exemplar replay (row 3) partially alleviates forgetting by maintaining
a buffer of past examples. This yields notable gains fors1in Phase 2 (+18.51%) and Phase 3
(+10.38%), and also improvess2in Phase 3 (+9.43%). However, the overall forgetting
remains substantial (FPP: 46.44), showing ER alone is insufficient. Effect of PLG.The addition of the pseudo-label generator (PLG), which generates labels for
previous classes by retaining a copy of the model from an earlier phase, facilitates knowledge
retention and forward transfer. As shown in row 4, PLG significantly reduces forgetting and
enhances performance on current tasks. Fors1, it improves mAP 50 by 31.49% in Phase 2
and 39.40% in Phase 3 over exemplar replay. Overall, PLG yields a 15.00% increase in
performance and reduces forgetting by 39.40%. Effect of CBR.Finally, class-balanced re-weighting (CBR) mitigates class imbalance dur-
ing both pseudo-labelling and current task learning by adjusting each class’s contribution
based on its frequency. As shown in row 5, CBR enhancess1retention over PLG in Phases 2
and 3 (+4.67% and +4.41%), and further improves performance ons2ands3. It also achieves
the lowest FPP of 2.63, reflecting strong forgetting mitigation. Overall, CBR offers the best
trade-off between retaining past knowledge and acquiring new tasks, outperforming PLG
and ER by 4.41% and 43.81%, respectively. 4.4 Limitations & Future Work
While CLIMB-3D achieves strong performance across CI-3DIS and CI-3DSS settings, sev-
eral limitations remain and warrant discussion. The experiments are currently limited to
indoor datasets (ScanNet200 and ScanNetV2), therefore evaluating performance on outdoor
scenes would help assess generalisability across diverse environments. The current setup
also considers only three incremental phases, whereas real-world applications often involve
longer sequences; incorporating such extended setups would better reflect practical chal-
lenges. Moreover, the model operates in a uni-modal setting. Integrating multi-modal cues,
such as vision-language models, could further enhance performance, as suggested by recent
2D and 3D studies [25, 65, 66]. 5 Conclusion
This work addresses the challenge of catastrophic forgetting in class-incremental 3D in-
stance segmentation by introducing a modular framework that integrates exemplar replay
(ER), a pseudo-label generator (PLG), and class-balanced re-weighting (CBR). The pro-
posed method incrementally adapts to new classes while preserving prior knowledge, all
without requiring access to the full dataset. Extensive experiments on a three-phase bench-
mark validate the individual and combined effectiveness of each component: ER enables
efficient memory-based retention; PLG facilitates knowledge preservation through pseudo-
supervision; and CBR mitigates class imbalance to enhance learning stability. Together,
these components significantly reduce forgetting and improve segmentation performance
across all phases. By achieving a strong balance between stability and plasticity, our ap-
proach advances continual 3D scene understanding and sets a new baseline for future re-
search in this area. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D11

1 Introduction
Table Chair Couch Pillow Coffee Table Sofa Chair Recycling BinCabinet Unknown
Task-1 Task-2 Task-3
Figure 1:Overview of the CI-3DIS setting.New object categories are introduced incre-
mentally with each task. After every phase, the model must recognise both newly added
and previously learned classes. For instance, in Task 2, categories such asPillow,Coffee
Table, andSofa Chairare introduced, while the model is expected to retain recognition
of earlier classes likeTable,Chair, andCouch. 3D instance segmentation (3DIS) is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves
identifying precise object boundaries and class labels in 3D space, with broad applications in
graphics, robotics, and augmented reality [4, 39]. Traditional 3DIS methods, including top-
down [28, 70, 78], bottom-up [26, 73], and transformer-based approaches [59], perform well
under the assumption that all classes are available and balanced during training. However,
this assumption does not hold in real-world environments, where new object classes emerge
over time and exhibit natural imbalance. This gap motivates the need for Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) [17, 54], which sup-
ports learning new categories while retaining knowledge of previous ones [51]. While CIL
has seen success in 2D image tasks [1, 43, 54, 60], extensions to 3D point clouds remain
limited, often focusing on object-level classification [13, 18, 48]. Recent works on scene-
level class-incremental 3DIS (CI-3DIS) [4] and class-incremental semantic segmentation
(CI-3DSS) [74] show promise, but depend heavily on large exemplar [56] and overlook class
imbalance, limiting their practicality. To address this, we proposeCLIMB-3D, a unified framework forCLass-incremental
IMBalance-aware3DIS that jointly tackles catastrophic forgetting and class imbalance. The
framework begins with Exemplar Replay (ER), storing a small number of samples from
past classes for later replay. However, this alone does not yield promising results under the
strict memory constraints required in CI-3DIS. To address this, we introduce a Pseudo-Label
Generator (PLG), which uses a frozen model from previous task to generate supervision for
earlier classes. However, we observed that PLG tends to favour frequent classes while ig-
noring under-represented ones. To mitigate this, we propose a Class-Balanced Re-weighting
(CBR), which estimates class frequencies from the pseudo-labels to enhance the learning of
rare classes without accessing past data. Together, these components form a practical and
effective solution for real-world 3DIS. To evaluate CLIMB-3D, we designed three benchmark scenarios for CI-3DIS based on
the ScanNet200 dataset [57]. These scenarios simulate incremental learning setup under nat-
ural class imbalance, where new classes emerge based on (A) object frequency, (B) semantic
similarity, or (C) random grouping. Additionally, for comparison with existing methods,
we evaluate our approach on CI-3DSS using the ScanNetV2 dataset [16]. Experimental re-
sults show that our method significantly reduces forgetting and improves performance across
both frequent and rare categories, outperforming previous methods in both settings. Fig. 1
illustrates the CI-3DIS setup. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D3
In summary, our contributions are: (i) a novel problem setting of imbalanced class-
incremental 3DIS with an effective method to balance learning and mitigate forgetting; (ii)
three benchmarks modelling continual object emergence with natural imbalance; and (iii)
strong experimental results, achieving up to 16.76% mAP improvement over baselines. 2 Related Work
3D Instance Segmentation.Various methods have been proposed for 3DIS. Grouping-
based approaches adopt a bottom-up pipeline that learns latent embeddings for point cluster-
ing [9, 21, 22, 29, 37, 44, 70, 78]. In contrast, proposal-based methods follow a top-down
strategy by detecting 3D boxes and segmenting objects within them [19, 26, 46, 73, 76]. Recently, transformer-based models [68] have also been applied to 3DIS and 3DSS [59, 64],
inspired by advances in 2D vision [10, 11]. However, these approaches require full anno-
tations for all classes and are not designed for progressive learning, where only new class
annotations are available and previous data is inaccessible. Another line of work aims to re-
duce annotation costs by proposing weakly supervised 3DIS methods based on sparse cues
[12, 27, 72]. While effective with limited annotations, these methods assume a fixed set of
classes and are susceptible to catastrophic forgetting in incremental settings. Incremental Learning.Continual learning involves training models sequentially to miti-
gate catastrophic forgetting. One common strategy is model regularisation, which constrains
parameter updates using techniques such as elastic weight consolidation or knowledge dis-
tillation [1, 24, 35, 43, 60]. Another approach is exemplar replay, where past data is stored
or generated to rehearse older tasks while learning new ones [5, 7, 30, 54]. A third direc-
tion involves dynamically expanding the model architecture or using modular sub-networks
to accommodate new tasks without interfering with old ones [31, 42, 53, 58, 71, 79]. Re-
cent efforts in class-incremental 3D segmentation [63, 74] have shown early promise but
often rely on basic architectures and focus primarily on semantic segmentation. Other works
[4, 36] explore continual learning in 3D settings, though they often depend on large memory
buffers. In contrast, our work introduces a tailored framework for 3D instance segmentation
that effectively transfers knowledge across tasks, even under class imbalance. Long-tailed Recognition.Imbalanced class distributions lead to poor recognition of rare
(long-tail) classes. To address this, re-sampling methods balance the data via input [8, 20, 50,
52, 61] or feature space [3, 14, 40], avoiding naïve under-/over-sampling. Loss re-weighting
offers another direction, using class-based [6, 15, 23, 32, 33, 69] or per-example [45, 55, 62]
adjustments to ensure fair contribution. Parameter regularisation improves generalisation
through weight constraints [2], albeit requiring careful tuning. Other approaches leverage
transfer learning [77, 81], self-supervision [41, 75], or contrastive learning [34, 41, 82] to
improve rare-class representations. Long-tailed recognition is well-studied in 2D with large-
scale datasets [15, 49, 67]; in 3D, ScanNet200 [16, 57] enables similar efforts. Prior 3D
work focused on re-weighting, re-sampling, and transfer learning [57], while regularisation
remains underexplored. CeCo [80] balances class centres via auxiliary loss but overlooks
sampling and augmentation. Lahoud et al. [38] propose adaptive classifier regularisation
for 3D segmentation, outperforming prior approaches without threshold tuning. However,
neither method considers incremental learning. In contrast, we jointly address long-tail and
continual 3D semantic segmentation. 4THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D

Figure 2: Overview ofCLIMB-3Dfor CI-3DIS. The model incrementally learns new classes
across sequential phases. During taskt, point cloudsPand their corresponding labelsY t are
sampled from a combination of the current training datasetD t and Exemplar Replay (ER),
which maintains a small memory of past examples. These are then passed to the current
modelΦ t to produce predicted labelsY t . The Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG) selects the
top-Kpredictions from the previous modelΦ t−1 . These pseudo-labels are then weighted
based on class frequencyf(c)using Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR), and the top-Kre-
weighted labels are selected to form the balanced pseudo-label set ¯Yt . This pseudo-label set
is then concatenated with the ground-truth labels to form a final augmented supervision set
Yt for taskt, which is used to optimise the modelΦ t using Eq. (3). 3 Methodology
3.1 Problem Formulation
3DIS.The objective of this task is to detect and segment each object instance within a point
cloud. Formally, the training dataset is denoted asD={(P i,Yi)}N
i=1, whereNis the number
of training samples. Each inputP i ∈R M×6 is a coloured point cloud consisting ofMpoints,
where each point is represented by its 3D coordinates and RGB values. The corresponding
annotationY i ={(m i,j ,ci,j )}Ji
j=1 containsJ i object instances, wheremi,j ∈ {0,1}M is a binary
mask indicating which points belong to thej-th instance, andc i,j ∈ C={1,...,C}is the
semantic class label of that instance. GivenP i, the modelΦpredicts instance-level outputs
ˆYi ={(ˆmi,j ,ˆci,j )}
ˆJi
j=1, where ˆmi,j and ˆci,j denote the predicted mask and category label for
thej-th instance, respectively. The number of predicted instances ˆJi varies depending on the
model’s inference. The model is optimised using the following objective:

categories are introduced incrementally overTtraining tasks. Each tasktintroduces a dis-
joint set of classesC t , withC= ST

Overview.As shown in Fig. 2 and formulated in Sec. 3.1, the proposed framework for
CI-3DIS follows aphase-wisetraining strategy. In each phase, the model is exposed to a
carefully curated subset of the dataset, simulating real-world scenarios discussed in Sec. 3.3. Training naïvely on such phased data leads tocatastrophic forgetting[51], where the model
forgets prior knowledge when learning new tasks. To address this, we first incorporateEx-
emplar Replay(ER) [5], a strategy inspired by 2D incremental methods [1, 43, 54] and
recently extended to 3D settings [4], to mitigate forgetting by storing a small set of repre-
sentative samples from earlier phases. However, ER alone is insufficient to achieve robust
performance. To address this, two additional components are introduced: aPseudo-Label
Generator(PLG), which leverages a frozen model to generate supervision signals for previ-
ously seen classes, and aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) module that compensates for
class imbalance across phases. Each of these components is described in detail below 1. Exemplar Replay (ER).Inspired by Buzzega et al. [5], ER addresses the issue of catas-
trophic forgetting by allowing the model to retain a subset of data from earlier phases. During phaset, the model is trained not only on the current task dataD t , but also on a
set of exemplarsE 1:t−1, collected from previous phases. These exemplars are accumulated
incrementally:E 1:t−1 =E 1 ∪···∪E t−1 .Here,E t denotes the exemplar subset stored after
phaset, and|E t |denotes the exemplar replay size. The combined replay dataset is denoted
as:D t
ER =D t ∪E 1:t−1.Epoch training consists of two stages: first, the model is trained on
the current data,D t ; then it is trained using exemplars fromE 1:t−1. While previous CI-3DIS approaches rely on large exemplar sets to mitigate forgetting [4],
such strategies become impractical under memory constraints. Consequently, although ER
aids knowledge retention, it is insufficient on its own for robust performance with a limited
exemplar budget. Therefore, PLG and CBR are introduced to better preserve past represen-
tations and enhance generalisation across phases. Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG).In the CI-3DIS setting, during phaset(wheret>1),
although ground-truth labels for previously seen classes are unavailable, the model from the
previous phaseΦ t−1 , which preserves knowledge of past tasks, is retained. We use this
model to generate pseudo-labels for previously seen classes, thereby providing approximate
supervision during training. This allows the current modelΦt , to retain prior knowledge and
reduce forgetting, even without access to ground-truth annotations. Given a point cloud and label pair(P,Y t ), fromD t , the previous modelΦ t−1 , generates
pseudo-labels for the previously seen classes as ˆY1:t−1 =Φ t−1 (P), which we denote as ˜Yt
1For clarity, modifications introduced by each component (ER, PLG, and CBR) are highlighted in green, blue,
and red, respectively. 6THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D
for brevity. However, we observe that utilising all predictions fromΦt−1 introduces noisy or
incorrect labels, which degrade overall performance. To mitigate this, we select the top-K
most confident instance predictions, denoted as ˜Yt
K, and concatenate them with the ground-
truth labels of the current task to obtain the supervision set: ¯Yt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt
K. Following this,
the loss is computed over both the current task’s ground-truth labels and the top-Kconfi-
dent pseudo-labels from earlier phases, enabling the model to retain prior knowledge while
adapting to new classes. Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR).While ER and PLG contribute to preserving prior
knowledge, we observe that the model’s predictions are biased towards frequent classes,
resulting in the forgetting of rare categories. This issue is further amplified by the top-K
pseudo-labels selected by PLG, which predominantly represent dominant classes in the data. To address this, we propose aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) scheme that compensates
for class imbalance using object frequency statistics. At taskt, only the current datasetD t
and its label distributionp t (c)over classesc∈ Ct are available. Datasets and class distribu-
tions from earlier tasks{D i,p i(c)}t−1
i=1 are no longer accessible, which makes it challenging
to directly account for class imbalance across all previously seen tasks. Therefore, we pro-
pose to leverage the pseudo-label predictions of the frozen modelΦ t−1 as a proxy for the
class distribution across previously learned categories. During each training iteration, the previous modelΦ t−1 is applied to the current inputP
to generate pseudo-labels ˜Yt , from which we accumulate class-wise frequency statistics for
previously learned classes. LetC1:t = St
i=1 Ci represent the union of all classes seen up to task
t. At the end of each epoch, we compute the overall class frequencyf∈R |C1:t | by combining
the pseudo-label distribution ˜pt (c)derived from ˜Yt with the ground-truth label distribution
pt (c)from the current task. The resulting frequency vectorf= [f(c)] c∈C1:t is then used to
compute class-wise weightsw= [w(c)] c∈C1:t , which guide balanced pseudo-label selection
and help the model focus on rare classes. In the next epoch, the modelΦ t−1 produces soft pseudo-label predictions ˜Yt (as de-
scribed in PLG) , where each component ˜Yt [c]denotes the confidence score for classc∈
C1:t−1. To promote balanced pseudo-label selection, class-wise re-weighting is applied using
w(c) = 1
f(c)+ε , whereεis a small constant for numerical stability. The adjusted predictions
are computed by applying the class-wise weights as: ˜Yt,w [c] =w(c)· ˜Yt [c],∀c∈ C 1:t−1. Top-Kselection is then applied to both the original and the re-weighted scores, yielding
two pseudo-label sets: ˜Yt
K and ˜Yt,w
K , respectively. The final augmented target set, Yt , is
constructed by concatenating the ground-truth labelsY t with both sets of pseudo-labels:
Yt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt
K ∥ ˜Yt,w
K .(2)
Although the above re-weighting mitigates bias from prior tasks, it does not address class
imbalance within the current taskt. To resolve this, the class-balanced weightsw c are ex-
tended to incorporate statistics from both previously seen and current classes, i.e., overC 1:t
rather than onlyC 1:t−1. The updated weights, denoted asw ′
c, are used to re-weights both
pseudo-label selection and classification loss, ensuring balanced supervision across all seen
categories, including rare ones. This unified strategy reduces bias and enhances performance
across phases. The pseudo-code for constructing the supervision set in Eq. (2), which incor-
porates both PLG and CBR components, is provided in Appendix A. Final Objective.The final training objective ofCLIMB-3D, incorporating ER, PLG, and THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D7

While CI-3DIS methods offer a wide range of practical applications, they frequently rely
on the assumption of uniform sample distribution, which rarely holds in real-world settings. In practice, the number of object categories, denoted byC, is often large and characterised
by substantial variability in category frequency, shape, structure, and size. To address these
challenges, we propose three incremental learning scenarios, each designed to capture a
different facet of real-world complexity. The design of these scenarios is detailed below; for
further information and illustrations, refer to Appendix E of the supplementary material. Split-A: Frequency Scenarios.This scenario acknowledges that datasets are often la-
belled based on the frequency of categories. To accommodate this, we propose a split where
the model learns from the most frequent categories and subsequently incorporates the less
frequent ones in later stages. By prioritising the training of frequently occurring categories,
the model can establish a strong foundation before expanding to handle rare categories. Split-B: Semantic Scenarios.Beyond frequency, semantic similarity is crucial in real-
world deployments. While objects often share visual or functional traits, models may en-
counter semantically different categories in new environments. To simulate this challenge,
we introduce theSplit-Bscenario. Here, categories are grouped based on their semantic
relationships, and the model is incrementally trained on one semantic group at a time. This
setup encourages the model to generalise across semantically similar categories and adapt
more effectively when exposed to new ones. Unlike theSplit-Ascenario, which organises
learning based on category frequency, theSplit-Bscenario may contain both frequent and
infrequent categories within a single task, focusing on semantic continuity and transfer. Split-C: Random Scenarios.In some cases, data labelling is driven by the availability of
objects rather than predefined criteria. To capture this, we introduce theSplit-Cscenario,
which represents a fully random setting where any class can appear in any task, resulting in
varying levels of class imbalance. By exposing the model to such diverse and unpredictable
distributions, we aim to improve its robustness in real-world situations where labelled data
availability is inconsistent. These incremental scenarios are designed to provide a more realistic representation of
object distributions, frequencies, and dynamics encountered in the real world. 4 Experiments

assessing real-world scenarios. In addition, we compare our approach against existing in-
cremental learning methods using ScanNetV2 [16] in the 3DSS setting. For this evaluation,
we follow the standard training and validation splits defined in prior works [74] to ensure
consistency with existing methods. Evaluation Metrics.We evaluate our method usingMean Average Precision(mAP), a
standard metric for 3DIS which provides a comprehensive measure of segmentation quality
by accounting for both precision and recall. For comparison with existing 3DSS methods,
we report themean Intersection over Union(mIoU), which quantifies the overlap between
predicted and ground truth segments. To assess the model’s ability to mitigate catastrophic
forgetting in incremental settings, we use theForgetting Percentage Points(FPP) metric, as
defined in [47]. FPP captures performance degradation by measuring the accuracy drop on
the initially seen categories between the first and final training phases. Detailed descriptions of the incremental scenarios (Split-A,Split-B,Split-C) and im-
plementation are provided in Appendix B. 4.2 Results and Discussion

To evaluate our proposed approach, we construct a baseline using ER [5] for the 3DIS
setting, as no existing incremental baselines are available for this task. In contrast, for the
3DSS setting, where incremental baselines do exist, we compare our method against three
prior approaches [43, 60, 74]. Results on CI-3DIS.Tab. 1 compares CLIMB-3D against the ER baseline across the three
CI-3DIS scenarios, evaluated after all phases using mAP 25, mAP50, overall mAP, and FPP. In theSplit-Ascenario, characterised by significant distribution shifts, our method achieves
gains of +19.23%, +16.76%, and +12.28% in mAP 25, mAP 50, and overall mAP, respec-
tively, while drastically reducing forgetting with FPP scores of 3.44% (mAP 25) and 2.63%
(mAP50), both over 45 points lower than the baseline. Under theSplit-Bscenario, with
semantically related new categories, improvements of +18.26%, +16.49%, and +12.76%
are observed alongside a reduction in forgetting to 8.00% and 5.51% from baseline levels
above 42%. For theSplit-Cscenario, featuring increasing geometric complexity, CLIMB-
3D maintains solid gains of +5.94%, +5.70%, and +4.08% across mAP metrics, with forget-
ting reduced by over 22 points. Overall, these results demonstrate robust forward transfer,
minimal forgetting, and stable learning, highlighting the method’s effectiveness for scalable
continual 3D semantic understanding. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D9

Results on CI-3DSS.Although our primary focus is on CI-3DIS, we also evaluate our
method under the CI-3DSS setting to enable comparisons with existing approaches. To do
so, we adapt our predictions to assign each point the label corresponding to the highest-
confidence mask and exclude background classes (e.g., floor and wall), as these are not part
of the semantic segmentation targets. Tab. 2 presents a comparison between our method and
existing baselines on the ScanNet V2 dataset [16], evaluated using mIoU across two training
phases and overall. Although originally designed for instance segmentation, our method
generalises effectively to semantic segmentation, achieving substantial gains of +35.23%
mIoU in Phase 1 and +19.1% in Phase 2. Overall, it achieves 59.38% mIoU, significantly
higher than the∼30% mIoU of prior methods, highlighting its robustness and transferability. Refer to Appendix C, D, and F of the supplementary material for detailed analyses of per-
phase performance, rare-class evaluation, and qualitative result comparisons, respectively. 4.3 Ablation

We conduct an ablation study to evaluate the contribution of each component in our
framework. As an upper bound, we report the performance of anOraclemodel, which is
trained jointly on the full dataset. For the incremental setting, we follow the previously
defined splits and first train the model naively across phases. We then incrementally add
each module to isolate its impact. Tab. 3 presents results for theSplit-Ascenario using both
mAP50 and FPP metrics. Naïve Training.When trained naïvely without any dedicated modules, the model suffers
from severe catastrophic forgetting, as evident in row 2. The model entirely forgets pre-
viously learned classes upon entering new phases, with performance dropping to zero for
earlier splits and FPP rising to 56.82. 10THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D
Effect of ER.Adding exemplar replay (row 3) partially alleviates forgetting by maintaining
a buffer of past examples. This yields notable gains fors1in Phase 2 (+18.51%) and Phase 3
(+10.38%), and also improvess2in Phase 3 (+9.43%). However, the overall forgetting
remains substantial (FPP: 46.44), showing ER alone is insufficient. Effect of PLG.The addition of the pseudo-label generator (PLG), which generates labels for
previous classes by retaining a copy of the model from an earlier phase, facilitates knowledge
retention and forward transfer. As shown in row 4, PLG significantly reduces forgetting and
enhances performance on current tasks. Fors1, it improves mAP 50 by 31.49% in Phase 2
and 39.40% in Phase 3 over exemplar replay. Overall, PLG yields a 15.00% increase in
performance and reduces forgetting by 39.40%. Effect of CBR.Finally, class-balanced re-weighting (CBR) mitigates class imbalance dur-
ing both pseudo-labelling and current task learning by adjusting each class’s contribution
based on its frequency. As shown in row 5, CBR enhancess1retention over PLG in Phases 2
and 3 (+4.67% and +4.41%), and further improves performance ons2ands3. It also achieves
the lowest FPP of 2.63, reflecting strong forgetting mitigation. Overall, CBR offers the best
trade-off between retaining past knowledge and acquiring new tasks, outperforming PLG
and ER by 4.41% and 43.81%, respectively. 4.4 Limitations & Future Work
While CLIMB-3D achieves strong performance across CI-3DIS and CI-3DSS settings, sev-
eral limitations remain and warrant discussion. The experiments are currently limited to
indoor datasets (ScanNet200 and ScanNetV2), therefore evaluating performance on outdoor
scenes would help assess generalisability across diverse environments. The current setup
also considers only three incremental phases, whereas real-world applications often involve
longer sequences; incorporating such extended setups would better reflect practical chal-
lenges. Moreover, the model operates in a uni-modal setting. Integrating multi-modal cues,
such as vision-language models, could further enhance performance, as suggested by recent
2D and 3D studies [25, 65, 66]. 5 Conclusion
This work addresses the challenge of catastrophic forgetting in class-incremental 3D in-
stance segmentation by introducing a modular framework that integrates exemplar replay
(ER), a pseudo-label generator (PLG), and class-balanced re-weighting (CBR). The pro-
posed method incrementally adapts to new classes while preserving prior knowledge, all
without requiring access to the full dataset. Extensive experiments on a three-phase bench-
mark validate the individual and combined effectiveness of each component: ER enables
efficient memory-based retention; PLG facilitates knowledge preservation through pseudo-
supervision; and CBR mitigates class imbalance to enhance learning stability. Together,
these components significantly reduce forgetting and improve segmentation performance
across all phases. By achieving a strong balance between stability and plasticity, our ap-
proach advances continual 3D scene understanding and sets a new baseline for future re-
search in this area. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D11

5 and Tab. 6, correspond to evaluations onSplit-AforPhase
2andPhase 3, respectively. InPhase 2, we evaluate classes seen 1–20 times per epoch,
whilePhase 3targets even less frequent classes, with observations limited to 1–10 times per
epoch. As illustrated in Tab. 5, the IC module substantially improves performance on rare
classes in terms of mAP 50 in Phase 2 ofSplit-A. For instance, classes likerecycling
binandtrash bin, seen only 3 and 7 times, respectively, shows significant improvement
when the IC module is applied. Overall, the IC module provides an average boost of 8.32%,
highlighting its effectiveness in mitigating class imbalance. Similarly, Tab. 6 presents results forPhase 3, demonstrating significant gains for infre-
quent classes. For example, even though the classes such aspiano,bucket, andlaundry
basketare observed only once, IC module improves the performance by 52.30%, 10.40%,
and 13.60%, respectively. The ER+KD module does not focus on rare classes likeshower

Tab. 7 presents the task splits for each proposed scenario introduced in Section 4.3 using the
ScanNet200 dataset. The three scenarios,Split-A,Split-B, andSplit-C, are each divided
into three tasks: Task 1, Task 2, and Task 3. Notably, the order of classes in these tasks is
random. Appendix E Qualitative Results
In this section, we present a qualitative comparison of the proposed framework with the
baseline method. Fig. 4 illustrates the results on theSplit-Aevaluation after learning all
tasks, comparing the performance of the baseline method and our proposed approach. As
shown in the figure, our method demonstrates superior instance segmentation performance
compared to the baseline. For example, in row 1, the baseline method fails to segment
thesink, while in row 3, thesofainstance is missed. Overall, our framework consistently
outperforms the baseline, with several missed instances by the baseline highlighted in red 4THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D

5 and Tab. 6, correspond to evaluations onSplit-AforPhase
2andPhase 3, respectively. InPhase 2, we evaluate classes seen 1–20 times per epoch,
whilePhase 3targets even less frequent classes, with observations limited to 1–10 times per
epoch. As illustrated in Tab. 5, the IC module substantially improves performance on rare
classes in terms of mAP 50 in Phase 2 ofSplit-A. For instance, classes likerecycling
binandtrash bin, seen only 3 and 7 times, respectively, shows significant improvement
when the IC module is applied. Overall, the IC module provides an average boost of 8.32%,
highlighting its effectiveness in mitigating class imbalance. Similarly, Tab. 6 presents results forPhase 3, demonstrating significant gains for infre-
quent classes. For example, even though the classes such aspiano,bucket, andlaundry
basketare observed only once, IC module improves the performance by 52.30%, 10.40%,
and 13.60%, respectively. The ER+KD module does not focus on rare classes likeshower

ance by focusing on underrepresented categories. On average, the addition of the proposed THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D3

Tab. 7 presents the task splits for each proposed scenario introduced in Section 4.3 using the
ScanNet200 dataset. The three scenarios,Split-A,Split-B, andSplit-C, are each divided
into three tasks: Task 1, Task 2, and Task 3. Notably, the order of classes in these tasks is
random. Appendix E Qualitative Results
In this section, we present a qualitative comparison of the proposed framework with the
baseline method. Fig. 4 illustrates the results on theSplit-Aevaluation after learning all
tasks, comparing the performance of the baseline method and our proposed approach. As
shown in the figure, our method demonstrates superior instance segmentation performance
compared to the baseline. For example, in row 1, the baseline method fails to segment
thesink, while in row 3, thesofainstance is missed. Overall, our framework consistently
outperforms the baseline, with several missed instances by the baseline highlighted in red 4THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D

Abstract
While 3D instance segmentation (3DIS) has advanced significantly, most existing
methods assume that all object classes are known in advance and uniformly distributed. However, this assumption is unrealistic in dynamic, real-world environments where new
classes emerge gradually and exhibit natural imbalance. Although some approaches ad-
dress the emergence of new classes, they often overlook class imbalance, which leads
to suboptimal performance, particularly on rare categories. To tackle this, we propose
CLIMB-3D, a unified framework forCLass-incrementalImbalance-aware3DIS. Build-
ing upon established exemplar replay (ER) strategies, we show that ER alone is insuf-
ficient to achieve robust performance under memory constraints. To mitigate this, we
introduce a novel pseudo-label generator (PLG) that extends supervision to previously
learned categories by leveraging predictions from a frozen model trained on prior tasks. Despite its promise, PLG tends to be biased towards frequent classes. Therefore, we
propose a class-balanced re-weighting (CBR) scheme that estimates object frequencies
from pseudo-labels and dynamically adjusts training bias, without requiring access to
past data. We design and evaluate three incremental scenarios for 3DIS on the challeng-
ing ScanNet200 dataset and additionally validate our method for semantic segmentation
on ScanNetV2. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing prior work by
up to 16.76% mAP for instance segmentation and approximately 30% mIoU for semantic
segmentation, demonstrating strong generalisation across both frequent and rare classes. Code is available at:https://github.com/vgthengane/CLIMB3D. © 2025.

1 Introduction
Table Chair Couch Pillow Coffee Table Sofa Chair Recycling BinCabinet Unknown
Task-1 Task-2 Task-3
Figure 1:Overview of the CI-3DIS setting.New object categories are introduced incre-
mentally with each task. After every phase, the model must recognise both newly added
and previously learned classes. For instance, in Task 2, categories such asPillow,Coffee
Table, andSofa Chairare introduced, while the model is expected to retain recognition
of earlier classes likeTable,Chair, andCouch. 3D instance segmentation (3DIS) is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves
identifying precise object boundaries and class labels in 3D space, with broad applications in
graphics, robotics, and augmented reality [4, 39]. Traditional 3DIS methods, including top-
down [28, 70, 78], bottom-up [26, 73], and transformer-based approaches [59], perform well
under the assumption that all classes are available and balanced during training. However,
this assumption does not hold in real-world environments, where new object classes emerge
over time and exhibit natural imbalance. This gap motivates the need for Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) [17, 54], which sup-
ports learning new categories while retaining knowledge of previous ones [51]. While CIL
has seen success in 2D image tasks [1, 43, 54, 60], extensions to 3D point clouds remain
limited, often focusing on object-level classification [13, 18, 48]. Recent works on scene-
level class-incremental 3DIS (CI-3DIS) [4] and class-incremental semantic segmentation
(CI-3DSS) [74] show promise, but depend heavily on large exemplar [56] and overlook class
imbalance, limiting their practicality. To address this, we proposeCLIMB-3D, a unified framework forCLass-incremental
IMBalance-aware3DIS that jointly tackles catastrophic forgetting and class imbalance. The
framework begins with Exemplar Replay (ER), storing a small number of samples from
past classes for later replay. However, this alone does not yield promising results under the
strict memory constraints required in CI-3DIS. To address this, we introduce a Pseudo-Label
Generator (PLG), which uses a frozen model from previous task to generate supervision for
earlier classes. However, we observed that PLG tends to favour frequent classes while ig-
noring under-represented ones. To mitigate this, we propose a Class-Balanced Re-weighting
(CBR), which estimates class frequencies from the pseudo-labels to enhance the learning of
rare classes without accessing past data. Together, these components form a practical and
effective solution for real-world 3DIS. To evaluate CLIMB-3D, we designed three benchmark scenarios for CI-3DIS based on
the ScanNet200 dataset [57]. These scenarios simulate incremental learning setup under nat-
ural class imbalance, where new classes emerge based on (A) object frequency, (B) semantic
similarity, or (C) random grouping. Additionally, for comparison with existing methods,
we evaluate our approach on CI-3DSS using the ScanNetV2 dataset [16]. Experimental re-
sults show that our method significantly reduces forgetting and improves performance across
both frequent and rare categories, outperforming previous methods in both settings. Fig. 1
illustrates the CI-3DIS setup. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D3
In summary, our contributions are: (i) a novel problem setting of imbalanced class-
incremental 3DIS with an effective method to balance learning and mitigate forgetting; (ii)
three benchmarks modelling continual object emergence with natural imbalance; and (iii)
strong experimental results, achieving up to 16.76% mAP improvement over baselines. 2 Related Work
3D Instance Segmentation.Various methods have been proposed for 3DIS. Grouping-
based approaches adopt a bottom-up pipeline that learns latent embeddings for point cluster-
ing [9, 21, 22, 29, 37, 44, 70, 78]. In contrast, proposal-based methods follow a top-down
strategy by detecting 3D boxes and segmenting objects within them [19, 26, 46, 73, 76]. Recently, transformer-based models [68] have also been applied to 3DIS and 3DSS [59, 64],
inspired by advances in 2D vision [10, 11]. However, these approaches require full anno-
tations for all classes and are not designed for progressive learning, where only new class
annotations are available and previous data is inaccessible. Another line of work aims to re-
duce annotation costs by proposing weakly supervised 3DIS methods based on sparse cues
[12, 27, 72]. While effective with limited annotations, these methods assume a fixed set of
classes and are susceptible to catastrophic forgetting in incremental settings. Incremental Learning.Continual learning involves training models sequentially to miti-
gate catastrophic forgetting. One common strategy is model regularisation, which constrains
parameter updates using techniques such as elastic weight consolidation or knowledge dis-
tillation [1, 24, 35, 43, 60]. Another approach is exemplar replay, where past data is stored
or generated to rehearse older tasks while learning new ones [5, 7, 30, 54]. A third direc-
tion involves dynamically expanding the model architecture or using modular sub-networks
to accommodate new tasks without interfering with old ones [31, 42, 53, 58, 71, 79]. Re-
cent efforts in class-incremental 3D segmentation [63, 74] have shown early promise but
often rely on basic architectures and focus primarily on semantic segmentation. Other works
[4, 36] explore continual learning in 3D settings, though they often depend on large memory
buffers. In contrast, our work introduces a tailored framework for 3D instance segmentation
that effectively transfers knowledge across tasks, even under class imbalance. Long-tailed Recognition.Imbalanced class distributions lead to poor recognition of rare
(long-tail) classes. To address this, re-sampling methods balance the data via input [8, 20, 50,
52, 61] or feature space [3, 14, 40], avoiding naïve under-/over-sampling. Loss re-weighting
offers another direction, using class-based [6, 15, 23, 32, 33, 69] or per-example [45, 55, 62]
adjustments to ensure fair contribution. Parameter regularisation improves generalisation
through weight constraints [2], albeit requiring careful tuning. Other approaches leverage
transfer learning [77, 81], self-supervision [41, 75], or contrastive learning [34, 41, 82] to
improve rare-class representations. Long-tailed recognition is well-studied in 2D with large-
scale datasets [15, 49, 67]; in 3D, ScanNet200 [16, 57] enables similar efforts. Prior 3D
work focused on re-weighting, re-sampling, and transfer learning [57], while regularisation
remains underexplored. CeCo [80] balances class centres via auxiliary loss but overlooks
sampling and augmentation. Lahoud et al. [38] propose adaptive classifier regularisation
for 3D segmentation, outperforming prior approaches without threshold tuning. However,
neither method considers incremental learning. In contrast, we jointly address long-tail and
continual 3D semantic segmentation. 4THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D

Figure 2: Overview ofCLIMB-3Dfor CI-3DIS. The model incrementally learns new classes
across sequential phases. During taskt, point cloudsPand their corresponding labelsY t are
sampled from a combination of the current training datasetD t and Exemplar Replay (ER),
which maintains a small memory of past examples. These are then passed to the current
modelΦ t to produce predicted labelsY t . The Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG) selects the
top-Kpredictions from the previous modelΦ t−1 . These pseudo-labels are then weighted
based on class frequencyf(c)using Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR), and the top-Kre-
weighted labels are selected to form the balanced pseudo-label set ¯Yt . This pseudo-label set
is then concatenated with the ground-truth labels to form a final augmented supervision set
Yt for taskt, which is used to optimise the modelΦ t using Eq. (3). 3 Methodology
3.1 Problem Formulation
3DIS.The objective of this task is to detect and segment each object instance within a point
cloud. Formally, the training dataset is denoted asD={(P i,Yi)}N
i=1, whereNis the number
of training samples. Each inputP i ∈R M×6 is a coloured point cloud consisting ofMpoints,
where each point is represented by its 3D coordinates and RGB values. The corresponding
annotationY i ={(m i,j ,ci,j )}Ji
j=1 containsJ i object instances, wheremi,j ∈ {0,1}M is a binary
mask indicating which points belong to thej-th instance, andc i,j ∈ C={1,...,C}is the
semantic class label of that instance. GivenP i, the modelΦpredicts instance-level outputs
ˆYi ={(ˆmi,j ,ˆci,j )}
ˆJi
j=1, where ˆmi,j and ˆci,j denote the predicted mask and category label for
thej-th instance, respectively. The number of predicted instances ˆJi varies depending on the
model’s inference. The model is optimised using the following objective:
L3DIS(D;Φ) = 1

whereL cls andL mask are the average classification and mask losses over all instances, andλ
controls their trade-off. CI-3DIS.Unlike conventional 3DIS, CI-3DIS involves sequential learning, where object
categories are introduced incrementally overTtraining tasks. Each tasktintroduces a dis-
joint set of classesC t , withC= ST

Overview.As shown in Fig. 2 and formulated in Sec. 3.1, the proposed framework for
CI-3DIS follows aphase-wisetraining strategy. In each phase, the model is exposed to a
carefully curated subset of the dataset, simulating real-world scenarios discussed in Sec. 3.3. Training naïvely on such phased data leads tocatastrophic forgetting[51], where the model
forgets prior knowledge when learning new tasks. To address this, we first incorporateEx-
emplar Replay(ER) [5], a strategy inspired by 2D incremental methods [1, 43, 54] and
recently extended to 3D settings [4], to mitigate forgetting by storing a small set of repre-
sentative samples from earlier phases. However, ER alone is insufficient to achieve robust
performance. To address this, two additional components are introduced: aPseudo-Label
Generator(PLG), which leverages a frozen model to generate supervision signals for previ-
ously seen classes, and aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) module that compensates for
class imbalance across phases. Each of these components is described in detail below 1. Exemplar Replay (ER).Inspired by Buzzega et al. [5], ER addresses the issue of catas-
trophic forgetting by allowing the model to retain a subset of data from earlier phases. During phaset, the model is trained not only on the current task dataD t , but also on a
set of exemplarsE 1:t−1, collected from previous phases. These exemplars are accumulated
incrementally:E 1:t−1 =E 1 ∪···∪E t−1 .Here,E t denotes the exemplar subset stored after
phaset, and|E t |denotes the exemplar replay size. The combined replay dataset is denoted
as:D t
ER =D t ∪E 1:t−1.Epoch training consists of two stages: first, the model is trained on
the current data,D t ; then it is trained using exemplars fromE 1:t−1. While previous CI-3DIS approaches rely on large exemplar sets to mitigate forgetting [4],
such strategies become impractical under memory constraints. Consequently, although ER
aids knowledge retention, it is insufficient on its own for robust performance with a limited
exemplar budget. Therefore, PLG and CBR are introduced to better preserve past represen-
tations and enhance generalisation across phases. Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG).In the CI-3DIS setting, during phaset(wheret>1),
although ground-truth labels for previously seen classes are unavailable, the model from the
previous phaseΦ t−1 , which preserves knowledge of past tasks, is retained. We use this
model to generate pseudo-labels for previously seen classes, thereby providing approximate
supervision during training. This allows the current modelΦt , to retain prior knowledge and
reduce forgetting, even without access to ground-truth annotations. Given a point cloud and label pair(P,Y t ), fromD t , the previous modelΦ t−1 , generates
pseudo-labels for the previously seen classes as ˆY1:t−1 =Φ t−1 (P), which we denote as ˜Yt
1For clarity, modifications introduced by each component (ER, PLG, and CBR) are highlighted in green, blue,
and red, respectively. 6THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D
for brevity. However, we observe that utilising all predictions fromΦt−1 introduces noisy or
incorrect labels, which degrade overall performance. To mitigate this, we select the top-K
most confident instance predictions, denoted as ˜Yt
K, and concatenate them with the ground-
truth labels of the current task to obtain the supervision set: ¯Yt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt
K. Following this,
the loss is computed over both the current task’s ground-truth labels and the top-Kconfi-
dent pseudo-labels from earlier phases, enabling the model to retain prior knowledge while
adapting to new classes. Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR).While ER and PLG contribute to preserving prior
knowledge, we observe that the model’s predictions are biased towards frequent classes,
resulting in the forgetting of rare categories. This issue is further amplified by the top-K
pseudo-labels selected by PLG, which predominantly represent dominant classes in the data. To address this, we propose aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) scheme that compensates
for class imbalance using object frequency statistics. At taskt, only the current datasetD t
and its label distributionp t (c)over classesc∈ Ct are available. Datasets and class distribu-
tions from earlier tasks{D i,p i(c)}t−1
i=1 are no longer accessible, which makes it challenging
to directly account for class imbalance across all previously seen tasks. Therefore, we pro-
pose to leverage the pseudo-label predictions of the frozen modelΦ t−1 as a proxy for the
class distribution across previously learned categories. During each training iteration, the previous modelΦ t−1 is applied to the current inputP
to generate pseudo-labels ˜Yt , from which we accumulate class-wise frequency statistics for
previously learned classes. LetC1:t = St
i=1 Ci represent the union of all classes seen up to task
t. At the end of each epoch, we compute the overall class frequencyf∈R |C1:t | by combining
the pseudo-label distribution ˜pt (c)derived from ˜Yt with the ground-truth label distribution
pt (c)from the current task. The resulting frequency vectorf= [f(c)] c∈C1:t is then used to
compute class-wise weightsw= [w(c)] c∈C1:t , which guide balanced pseudo-label selection
and help the model focus on rare classes. In the next epoch, the modelΦ t−1 produces soft pseudo-label predictions ˜Yt (as de-
scribed in PLG) , where each component ˜Yt [c]denotes the confidence score for classc∈
C1:t−1. To promote balanced pseudo-label selection, class-wise re-weighting is applied using
w(c) = 1
f(c)+ε , whereεis a small constant for numerical stability. The adjusted predictions
are computed by applying the class-wise weights as: ˜Yt,w [c] =w(c)· ˜Yt [c],∀c∈ C 1:t−1. Top-Kselection is then applied to both the original and the re-weighted scores, yielding
two pseudo-label sets: ˜Yt
K and ˜Yt,w
K , respectively. The final augmented target set, Yt , is
constructed by concatenating the ground-truth labelsY t with both sets of pseudo-labels:
Yt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt
K ∥ ˜Yt,w
K .(2)
Although the above re-weighting mitigates bias from prior tasks, it does not address class
imbalance within the current taskt. To resolve this, the class-balanced weightsw c are ex-
tended to incorporate statistics from both previously seen and current classes, i.e., overC 1:t
rather than onlyC 1:t−1. The updated weights, denoted asw ′
c, are used to re-weights both
pseudo-label selection and classification loss, ensuring balanced supervision across all seen
categories, including rare ones. This unified strategy reduces bias and enhances performance
across phases. The pseudo-code for constructing the supervision set in Eq. (2), which incor-
porates both PLG and CBR components, is provided in Appendix A. Final Objective.The final training objective ofCLIMB-3D, incorporating ER, PLG, and THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D7

While CI-3DIS methods offer a wide range of practical applications, they frequently rely
on the assumption of uniform sample distribution, which rarely holds in real-world settings. In practice, the number of object categories, denoted byC, is often large and characterised
by substantial variability in category frequency, shape, structure, and size. To address these
challenges, we propose three incremental learning scenarios, each designed to capture a
different facet of real-world complexity. The design of these scenarios is detailed below; for
further information and illustrations, refer to Appendix E of the supplementary material. Split-A: Frequency Scenarios.This scenario acknowledges that datasets are often la-
belled based on the frequency of categories. To accommodate this, we propose a split where
the model learns from the most frequent categories and subsequently incorporates the less
frequent ones in later stages. By prioritising the training of frequently occurring categories,
the model can establish a strong foundation before expanding to handle rare categories. Split-B: Semantic Scenarios.Beyond frequency, semantic similarity is crucial in real-
world deployments. While objects often share visual or functional traits, models may en-
counter semantically different categories in new environments. To simulate this challenge,
we introduce theSplit-Bscenario. Here, categories are grouped based on their semantic
relationships, and the model is incrementally trained on one semantic group at a time. This
setup encourages the model to generalise across semantically similar categories and adapt
more effectively when exposed to new ones. Unlike theSplit-Ascenario, which organises
learning based on category frequency, theSplit-Bscenario may contain both frequent and
infrequent categories within a single task, focusing on semantic continuity and transfer. Split-C: Random Scenarios.In some cases, data labelling is driven by the availability of
objects rather than predefined criteria. To capture this, we introduce theSplit-Cscenario,
which represents a fully random setting where any class can appear in any task, resulting in
varying levels of class imbalance. By exposing the model to such diverse and unpredictable
distributions, we aim to improve its robustness in real-world situations where labelled data
availability is inconsistent. These incremental scenarios are designed to provide a more realistic representation of
object distributions, frequencies, and dynamics encountered in the real world. 4 Experiments

assessing real-world scenarios. In addition, we compare our approach against existing in-
cremental learning methods using ScanNetV2 [16] in the 3DSS setting. For this evaluation,
we follow the standard training and validation splits defined in prior works [74] to ensure
consistency with existing methods. Evaluation Metrics.We evaluate our method usingMean Average Precision(mAP), a
standard metric for 3DIS which provides a comprehensive measure of segmentation quality
by accounting for both precision and recall. For comparison with existing 3DSS methods,
we report themean Intersection over Union(mIoU), which quantifies the overlap between
predicted and ground truth segments. To assess the model’s ability to mitigate catastrophic
forgetting in incremental settings, we use theForgetting Percentage Points(FPP) metric, as
defined in [47]. FPP captures performance degradation by measuring the accuracy drop on
the initially seen categories between the first and final training phases. Detailed descriptions of the incremental scenarios (Split-A,Split-B,Split-C) and im-
plementation are provided in Appendix B. 4.2 Results and Discussion

To evaluate our proposed approach, we construct a baseline using ER [5] for the 3DIS
setting, as no existing incremental baselines are available for this task. In contrast, for the
3DSS setting, where incremental baselines do exist, we compare our method against three
prior approaches [43, 60, 74]. Results on CI-3DIS.Tab. 1 compares CLIMB-3D against the ER baseline across the three
CI-3DIS scenarios, evaluated after all phases using mAP 25, mAP50, overall mAP, and FPP. In theSplit-Ascenario, characterised by significant distribution shifts, our method achieves
gains of +19.23%, +16.76%, and +12.28% in mAP 25, mAP 50, and overall mAP, respec-
tively, while drastically reducing forgetting with FPP scores of 3.44% (mAP 25) and 2.63%
(mAP50), both over 45 points lower than the baseline. Under theSplit-Bscenario, with
semantically related new categories, improvements of +18.26%, +16.49%, and +12.76%
are observed alongside a reduction in forgetting to 8.00% and 5.51% from baseline levels
above 42%. For theSplit-Cscenario, featuring increasing geometric complexity, CLIMB-
3D maintains solid gains of +5.94%, +5.70%, and +4.08% across mAP metrics, with forget-
ting reduced by over 22 points. Overall, these results demonstrate robust forward transfer,
minimal forgetting, and stable learning, highlighting the method’s effectiveness for scalable
continual 3D semantic understanding. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D9

Results on CI-3DSS.Although our primary focus is on CI-3DIS, we also evaluate our
method under the CI-3DSS setting to enable comparisons with existing approaches. To do
so, we adapt our predictions to assign each point the label corresponding to the highest-
confidence mask and exclude background classes (e.g., floor and wall), as these are not part
of the semantic segmentation targets. Tab. 2 presents a comparison between our method and
existing baselines on the ScanNet V2 dataset [16], evaluated using mIoU across two training
phases and overall. Although originally designed for instance segmentation, our method
generalises effectively to semantic segmentation, achieving substantial gains of +35.23%
mIoU in Phase 1 and +19.1% in Phase 2. Overall, it achieves 59.38% mIoU, significantly
higher than the∼30% mIoU of prior methods, highlighting its robustness and transferability. Refer to Appendix C, D, and F of the supplementary material for detailed analyses of per-
phase performance, rare-class evaluation, and qualitative result comparisons, respectively. 4.3 Ablation

We conduct an ablation study to evaluate the contribution of each component in our
framework. As an upper bound, we report the performance of anOraclemodel, which is
trained jointly on the full dataset. For the incremental setting, we follow the previously
defined splits and first train the model naively across phases. We then incrementally add
each module to isolate its impact. Tab. 3 presents results for theSplit-Ascenario using both
mAP50 and FPP metrics. Naïve Training.When trained naïvely without any dedicated modules, the model suffers
from severe catastrophic forgetting, as evident in row 2. The model entirely forgets pre-
viously learned classes upon entering new phases, with performance dropping to zero for
earlier splits and FPP rising to 56.82. 10THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D
Effect of ER.Adding exemplar replay (row 3) partially alleviates forgetting by maintaining
a buffer of past examples. This yields notable gains fors1in Phase 2 (+18.51%) and Phase 3
(+10.38%), and also improvess2in Phase 3 (+9.43%). However, the overall forgetting
remains substantial (FPP: 46.44), showing ER alone is insufficient. Effect of PLG.The addition of the pseudo-label generator (PLG), which generates labels for
previous classes by retaining a copy of the model from an earlier phase, facilitates knowledge
retention and forward transfer. As shown in row 4, PLG significantly reduces forgetting and
enhances performance on current tasks. Fors1, it improves mAP 50 by 31.49% in Phase 2
and 39.40% in Phase 3 over exemplar replay. Overall, PLG yields a 15.00% increase in
performance and reduces forgetting by 39.40%. Effect of CBR.Finally, class-balanced re-weighting (CBR) mitigates class imbalance dur-
ing both pseudo-labelling and current task learning by adjusting each class’s contribution
based on its frequency. As shown in row 5, CBR enhancess1retention over PLG in Phases 2
and 3 (+4.67% and +4.41%), and further improves performance ons2ands3. It also achieves
the lowest FPP of 2.63, reflecting strong forgetting mitigation. Overall, CBR offers the best
trade-off between retaining past knowledge and acquiring new tasks, outperforming PLG
and ER by 4.41% and 43.81%, respectively. 4.4 Limitations & Future Work
While CLIMB-3D achieves strong performance across CI-3DIS and CI-3DSS settings, sev-
eral limitations remain and warrant discussion. The experiments are currently limited to
indoor datasets (ScanNet200 and ScanNetV2), therefore evaluating performance on outdoor
scenes would help assess generalisability across diverse environments. The current setup
also considers only three incremental phases, whereas real-world applications often involve
longer sequences; incorporating such extended setups would better reflect practical chal-
lenges. Moreover, the model operates in a uni-modal setting. Integrating multi-modal cues,
such as vision-language models, could further enhance performance, as suggested by recent
2D and 3D studies [25, 65, 66]. 5 Conclusion
This work addresses the challenge of catastrophic forgetting in class-incremental 3D in-
stance segmentation by introducing a modular framework that integrates exemplar replay
(ER), a pseudo-label generator (PLG), and class-balanced re-weighting (CBR). The pro-
posed method incrementally adapts to new classes while preserving prior knowledge, all
without requiring access to the full dataset. Extensive experiments on a three-phase bench-
mark validate the individual and combined effectiveness of each component: ER enables
efficient memory-based retention; PLG facilitates knowledge preservation through pseudo-
supervision; and CBR mitigates class imbalance to enhance learning stability. Together,
these components significantly reduce forgetting and improve segmentation performance
across all phases. By achieving a strong balance between stability and plasticity, our ap-
proach advances continual 3D scene understanding and sets a new baseline for future re-
search in this area. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D11

Abstract
While 3D instance segmentation (3DIS) has advanced significantly, most existing
methods assume that all object classes are known in advance and uniformly distributed. However, this assumption is unrealistic in dynamic, real-world environments where new
classes emerge gradually and exhibit natural imbalance. Although some approaches ad-
dress the emergence of new classes, they often overlook class imbalance, which leads
to suboptimal performance, particularly on rare categories. To tackle this, we propose
CLIMB-3D, a unified framework forCLass-incrementalImbalance-aware3DIS. Build-
ing upon established exemplar replay (ER) strategies, we show that ER alone is insuf-
ficient to achieve robust performance under memory constraints. To mitigate this, we
introduce a novel pseudo-label generator (PLG) that extends supervision to previously
learned categories by leveraging predictions from a frozen model trained on prior tasks. Despite its promise, PLG tends to be biased towards frequent classes. Therefore, we
propose a class-balanced re-weighting (CBR) scheme that estimates object frequencies
from pseudo-labels and dynamically adjusts training bias, without requiring access to
past data. We design and evaluate three incremental scenarios for 3DIS on the challeng-
ing ScanNet200 dataset and additionally validate our method for semantic segmentation
on ScanNetV2. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing prior work by
up to 16.76% mAP for instance segmentation and approximately 30% mIoU for semantic
segmentation, demonstrating strong generalisation across both frequent and rare classes. Code is available at:https://github.com/vgthengane/CLIMB3D. © 2025.

Abstract
While 3D instance segmentation (3DIS) has advanced significantly, most existing
methods assume that all object classes are known in advance and uniformly distributed. However, this assumption is unrealistic in dynamic, real-world environments where new
classes emerge gradually and exhibit natural imbalance. Although some approaches ad-
dress the emergence of new classes, they often overlook class imbalance, which leads
to suboptimal performance, particularly on rare categories. To tackle this, we propose
CLIMB-3D, a unified framework forCLass-incrementalImbalance-aware3DIS. Build-
ing upon established exemplar replay (ER) strategies, we show that ER alone is insuf-
ficient to achieve robust performance under memory constraints. To mitigate this, we
introduce a novel pseudo-label generator (PLG) that extends supervision to previously
learned categories by leveraging predictions from a frozen model trained on prior tasks. Despite its promise, PLG tends to be biased towards frequent classes. Therefore, we
propose a class-balanced re-weighting (CBR) scheme that estimates object frequencies
from pseudo-labels and dynamically adjusts training bias, without requiring access to
past data. We design and evaluate three incremental scenarios for 3DIS on the challeng-
ing ScanNet200 dataset and additionally validate our method for semantic segmentation
on ScanNetV2. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing prior work by
up to 16.76% mAP for instance segmentation and approximately 30% mIoU for semantic
segmentation, demonstrating strong generalisation across both frequent and rare classes. Code is available at:https://github.com/vgthengane/CLIMB3D. © 2025.

1 Introduction
Table Chair Couch Pillow Coffee Table Sofa Chair Recycling BinCabinet Unknown
Task-1 Task-2 Task-3
Figure 1:Overview of the CI-3DIS setting.New object categories are introduced incre-
mentally with each task. After every phase, the model must recognise both newly added
and previously learned classes. For instance, in Task 2, categories such asPillow,Coffee
Table, andSofa Chairare introduced, while the model is expected to retain recognition
of earlier classes likeTable,Chair, andCouch. 3D instance segmentation (3DIS) is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves
identifying precise object boundaries and class labels in 3D space, with broad applications in
graphics, robotics, and augmented reality [4, 39]. Traditional 3DIS methods, including top-
down [28, 70, 78], bottom-up [26, 73], and transformer-based approaches [59], perform well
under the assumption that all classes are available and balanced during training. However,
this assumption does not hold in real-world environments, where new object classes emerge
over time and exhibit natural imbalance. This gap motivates the need for Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) [17, 54], which sup-
ports learning new categories while retaining knowledge of previous ones [51]. While CIL
has seen success in 2D image tasks [1, 43, 54, 60], extensions to 3D point clouds remain
limited, often focusing on object-level classification [13, 18, 48]. Recent works on scene-
level class-incremental 3DIS (CI-3DIS) [4] and class-incremental semantic segmentation
(CI-3DSS) [74] show promise, but depend heavily on large exemplar [56] and overlook class
imbalance, limiting their practicality. To address this, we proposeCLIMB-3D, a unified framework forCLass-incremental
IMBalance-aware3DIS that jointly tackles catastrophic forgetting and class imbalance. The
framework begins with Exemplar Replay (ER), storing a small number of samples from
past classes for later replay. However, this alone does not yield promising results under the
strict memory constraints required in CI-3DIS. To address this, we introduce a Pseudo-Label
Generator (PLG), which uses a frozen model from previous task to generate supervision for
earlier classes. However, we observed that PLG tends to favour frequent classes while ig-
noring under-represented ones. To mitigate this, we propose a Class-Balanced Re-weighting
(CBR), which estimates class frequencies from the pseudo-labels to enhance the learning of
rare classes without accessing past data. Together, these components form a practical and
effective solution for real-world 3DIS. To evaluate CLIMB-3D, we designed three benchmark scenarios for CI-3DIS based on
the ScanNet200 dataset [57]. These scenarios simulate incremental learning setup under nat-
ural class imbalance, where new classes emerge based on (A) object frequency, (B) semantic
similarity, or (C) random grouping. Additionally, for comparison with existing methods,
we evaluate our approach on CI-3DSS using the ScanNetV2 dataset [16]. Experimental re-
sults show that our method significantly reduces forgetting and improves performance across
both frequent and rare categories, outperforming previous methods in both settings. Fig. 1
illustrates the CI-3DIS setup. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D3
In summary, our contributions are: (i) a novel problem setting of imbalanced class-
incremental 3DIS with an effective method to balance learning and mitigate forgetting; (ii)
three benchmarks modelling continual object emergence with natural imbalance; and (iii)
strong experimental results, achieving up to 16.76% mAP improvement over baselines. 2 Related Work
3D Instance Segmentation.Various methods have been proposed for 3DIS. Grouping-
based approaches adopt a bottom-up pipeline that learns latent embeddings for point cluster-
ing [9, 21, 22, 29, 37, 44, 70, 78]. In contrast, proposal-based methods follow a top-down
strategy by detecting 3D boxes and segmenting objects within them [19, 26, 46, 73, 76]. Recently, transformer-based models [68] have also been applied to 3DIS and 3DSS [59, 64],
inspired by advances in 2D vision [10, 11]. However, these approaches require full anno-
tations for all classes and are not designed for progressive learning, where only new class
annotations are available and previous data is inaccessible. Another line of work aims to re-
duce annotation costs by proposing weakly supervised 3DIS methods based on sparse cues
[12, 27, 72]. While effective with limited annotations, these methods assume a fixed set of
classes and are susceptible to catastrophic forgetting in incremental settings. Incremental Learning.Continual learning involves training models sequentially to miti-
gate catastrophic forgetting. One common strategy is model regularisation, which constrains
parameter updates using techniques such as elastic weight consolidation or knowledge dis-
tillation [1, 24, 35, 43, 60]. Another approach is exemplar replay, where past data is stored
or generated to rehearse older tasks while learning new ones [5, 7, 30, 54]. A third direc-
tion involves dynamically expanding the model architecture or using modular sub-networks
to accommodate new tasks without interfering with old ones [31, 42, 53, 58, 71, 79]. Re-
cent efforts in class-incremental 3D segmentation [63, 74] have shown early promise but
often rely on basic architectures and focus primarily on semantic segmentation. Other works
[4, 36] explore continual learning in 3D settings, though they often depend on large memory
buffers. In contrast, our work introduces a tailored framework for 3D instance segmentation
that effectively transfers knowledge across tasks, even under class imbalance. Long-tailed Recognition.Imbalanced class distributions lead to poor recognition of rare
(long-tail) classes. To address this, re-sampling methods balance the data via input [8, 20, 50,
52, 61] or feature space [3, 14, 40], avoiding naïve under-/over-sampling. Loss re-weighting
offers another direction, using class-based [6, 15, 23, 32, 33, 69] or per-example [45, 55, 62]
adjustments to ensure fair contribution. Parameter regularisation improves generalisation
through weight constraints [2], albeit requiring careful tuning. Other approaches leverage
transfer learning [77, 81], self-supervision [41, 75], or contrastive learning [34, 41, 82] to
improve rare-class representations. Long-tailed recognition is well-studied in 2D with large-
scale datasets [15, 49, 67]; in 3D, ScanNet200 [16, 57] enables similar efforts. Prior 3D
work focused on re-weighting, re-sampling, and transfer learning [57], while regularisation
remains underexplored. CeCo [80] balances class centres via auxiliary loss but overlooks
sampling and augmentation. Lahoud et al. [38] propose adaptive classifier regularisation
for 3D segmentation, outperforming prior approaches without threshold tuning. However,
neither method considers incremental learning. In contrast, we jointly address long-tail and
continual 3D semantic segmentation. 4THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D

Figure 2: Overview ofCLIMB-3Dfor CI-3DIS. The model incrementally learns new classes
across sequential phases. During taskt, point cloudsPand their corresponding labelsY t are
sampled from a combination of the current training datasetD t and Exemplar Replay (ER),
which maintains a small memory of past examples. These are then passed to the current
modelΦ t to produce predicted labelsY t . The Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG) selects the
top-Kpredictions from the previous modelΦ t−1 . These pseudo-labels are then weighted
based on class frequencyf(c)using Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR), and the top-Kre-
weighted labels are selected to form the balanced pseudo-label set ¯Yt . This pseudo-label set
is then concatenated with the ground-truth labels to form a final augmented supervision set
Yt for taskt, which is used to optimise the modelΦ t using Eq. (3). 3 Methodology
3.1 Problem Formulation
3DIS.The objective of this task is to detect and segment each object instance within a point
cloud. Formally, the training dataset is denoted asD={(P i,Yi)}N
i=1, whereNis the number
of training samples. Each inputP i ∈R M×6 is a coloured point cloud consisting ofMpoints,
where each point is represented by its 3D coordinates and RGB values. The corresponding
annotationY i ={(m i,j ,ci,j )}Ji
j=1 containsJ i object instances, wheremi,j ∈ {0,1}M is a binary
mask indicating which points belong to thej-th instance, andc i,j ∈ C={1,...,C}is the
semantic class label of that instance. GivenP i, the modelΦpredicts instance-level outputs
ˆYi ={(ˆmi,j ,ˆci,j )}
ˆJi
j=1, where ˆmi,j and ˆci,j denote the predicted mask and category label for
thej-th instance, respectively. The number of predicted instances ˆJi varies depending on the
model’s inference. The model is optimised using the following objective:
L3DIS(D;Φ) = 1

whereL cls andL mask are the average classification and mask losses over all instances, andλ
controls their trade-off. CI-3DIS.Unlike conventional 3DIS, CI-3DIS involves sequential learning, where object
categories are introduced incrementally overTtraining tasks. Each tasktintroduces a dis-
joint set of classesC t , withC= ST

Overview.As shown in Fig. 2 and formulated in Sec. 3.1, the proposed framework for
CI-3DIS follows aphase-wisetraining strategy. In each phase, the model is exposed to a
carefully curated subset of the dataset, simulating real-world scenarios discussed in Sec. 3.3. Training naïvely on such phased data leads tocatastrophic forgetting[51], where the model
forgets prior knowledge when learning new tasks. To address this, we first incorporateEx-
emplar Replay(ER) [5], a strategy inspired by 2D incremental methods [1, 43, 54] and
recently extended to 3D settings [4], to mitigate forgetting by storing a small set of repre-
sentative samples from earlier phases. However, ER alone is insufficient to achieve robust
performance. To address this, two additional components are introduced: aPseudo-Label
Generator(PLG), which leverages a frozen model to generate supervision signals for previ-
ously seen classes, and aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) module that compensates for
class imbalance across phases. Each of these components is described in detail below 1. Exemplar Replay (ER).Inspired by Buzzega et al. [5], ER addresses the issue of catas-
trophic forgetting by allowing the model to retain a subset of data from earlier phases. During phaset, the model is trained not only on the current task dataD t , but also on a
set of exemplarsE 1:t−1, collected from previous phases. These exemplars are accumulated
incrementally:E 1:t−1 =E 1 ∪···∪E t−1 .Here,E t denotes the exemplar subset stored after
phaset, and|E t |denotes the exemplar replay size. The combined replay dataset is denoted
as:D t
ER =D t ∪E 1:t−1.Epoch training consists of two stages: first, the model is trained on
the current data,D t ; then it is trained using exemplars fromE 1:t−1. While previous CI-3DIS approaches rely on large exemplar sets to mitigate forgetting [4],
such strategies become impractical under memory constraints. Consequently, although ER
aids knowledge retention, it is insufficient on its own for robust performance with a limited
exemplar budget. Therefore, PLG and CBR are introduced to better preserve past represen-
tations and enhance generalisation across phases. Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG).In the CI-3DIS setting, during phaset(wheret>1),
although ground-truth labels for previously seen classes are unavailable, the model from the
previous phaseΦ t−1 , which preserves knowledge of past tasks, is retained. We use this
model to generate pseudo-labels for previously seen classes, thereby providing approximate
supervision during training. This allows the current modelΦt , to retain prior knowledge and
reduce forgetting, even without access to ground-truth annotations. Given a point cloud and label pair(P,Y t ), fromD t , the previous modelΦ t−1 , generates
pseudo-labels for the previously seen classes as ˆY1:t−1 =Φ t−1 (P), which we denote as ˜Yt
1For clarity, modifications introduced by each component (ER, PLG, and CBR) are highlighted in green, blue,
and red, respectively. 6THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D
for brevity. However, we observe that utilising all predictions fromΦt−1 introduces noisy or
incorrect labels, which degrade overall performance. To mitigate this, we select the top-K
most confident instance predictions, denoted as ˜Yt
K, and concatenate them with the ground-
truth labels of the current task to obtain the supervision set: ¯Yt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt
K. Following this,
the loss is computed over both the current task’s ground-truth labels and the top-Kconfi-
dent pseudo-labels from earlier phases, enabling the model to retain prior knowledge while
adapting to new classes. Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR).While ER and PLG contribute to preserving prior
knowledge, we observe that the model’s predictions are biased towards frequent classes,
resulting in the forgetting of rare categories. This issue is further amplified by the top-K
pseudo-labels selected by PLG, which predominantly represent dominant classes in the data. To address this, we propose aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) scheme that compensates
for class imbalance using object frequency statistics. At taskt, only the current datasetD t
and its label distributionp t (c)over classesc∈ Ct are available. Datasets and class distribu-
tions from earlier tasks{D i,p i(c)}t−1
i=1 are no longer accessible, which makes it challenging
to directly account for class imbalance across all previously seen tasks. Therefore, we pro-
pose to leverage the pseudo-label predictions of the frozen modelΦ t−1 as a proxy for the
class distribution across previously learned categories. During each training iteration, the previous modelΦ t−1 is applied to the current inputP
to generate pseudo-labels ˜Yt , from which we accumulate class-wise frequency statistics for
previously learned classes. LetC1:t = St
i=1 Ci represent the union of all classes seen up to task
t. At the end of each epoch, we compute the overall class frequencyf∈R |C1:t | by combining
the pseudo-label distribution ˜pt (c)derived from ˜Yt with the ground-truth label distribution
pt (c)from the current task. The resulting frequency vectorf= [f(c)] c∈C1:t is then used to
compute class-wise weightsw= [w(c)] c∈C1:t , which guide balanced pseudo-label selection
and help the model focus on rare classes. In the next epoch, the modelΦ t−1 produces soft pseudo-label predictions ˜Yt (as de-
scribed in PLG) , where each component ˜Yt [c]denotes the confidence score for classc∈
C1:t−1. To promote balanced pseudo-label selection, class-wise re-weighting is applied using
w(c) = 1
f(c)+ε , whereεis a small constant for numerical stability. The adjusted predictions
are computed by applying the class-wise weights as: ˜Yt,w [c] =w(c)· ˜Yt [c],∀c∈ C 1:t−1. Top-Kselection is then applied to both the original and the re-weighted scores, yielding
two pseudo-label sets: ˜Yt
K and ˜Yt,w
K , respectively. The final augmented target set, Yt , is
constructed by concatenating the ground-truth labelsY t with both sets of pseudo-labels:
Yt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt
K ∥ ˜Yt,w
K .(2)
Although the above re-weighting mitigates bias from prior tasks, it does not address class
imbalance within the current taskt. To resolve this, the class-balanced weightsw c are ex-
tended to incorporate statistics from both previously seen and current classes, i.e., overC 1:t
rather than onlyC 1:t−1. The updated weights, denoted asw ′
c, are used to re-weights both
pseudo-label selection and classification loss, ensuring balanced supervision across all seen
categories, including rare ones. This unified strategy reduces bias and enhances performance
across phases. The pseudo-code for constructing the supervision set in Eq. (2), which incor-
porates both PLG and CBR components, is provided in Appendix A. Final Objective.The final training objective ofCLIMB-3D, incorporating ER, PLG, and THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D7
CBR, is formulated in Eq. (1) as:

While CI-3DIS methods offer a wide range of practical applications, they frequently rely
on the assumption of uniform sample distribution, which rarely holds in real-world settings. In practice, the number of object categories, denoted byC, is often large and characterised
by substantial variability in category frequency, shape, structure, and size. To address these
challenges, we propose three incremental learning scenarios, each designed to capture a
different facet of real-world complexity. The design of these scenarios is detailed below; for
further information and illustrations, refer to Appendix E of the supplementary material. Split-A: Frequency Scenarios.This scenario acknowledges that datasets are often la-
belled based on the frequency of categories. To accommodate this, we propose a split where
the model learns from the most frequent categories and subsequently incorporates the less
frequent ones in later stages. By prioritising the training of frequently occurring categories,
the model can establish a strong foundation before expanding to handle rare categories. Split-B: Semantic Scenarios.Beyond frequency, semantic similarity is crucial in real-
world deployments. While objects often share visual or functional traits, models may en-
counter semantically different categories in new environments. To simulate this challenge,
we introduce theSplit-Bscenario. Here, categories are grouped based on their semantic
relationships, and the model is incrementally trained on one semantic group at a time. This
setup encourages the model to generalise across semantically similar categories and adapt
more effectively when exposed to new ones. Unlike theSplit-Ascenario, which organises
learning based on category frequency, theSplit-Bscenario may contain both frequent and
infrequent categories within a single task, focusing on semantic continuity and transfer. Split-C: Random Scenarios.In some cases, data labelling is driven by the availability of
objects rather than predefined criteria. To capture this, we introduce theSplit-Cscenario,
which represents a fully random setting where any class can appear in any task, resulting in
varying levels of class imbalance. By exposing the model to such diverse and unpredictable
distributions, we aim to improve its robustness in real-world situations where labelled data
availability is inconsistent. These incremental scenarios are designed to provide a more realistic representation of
object distributions, frequencies, and dynamics encountered in the real world. 4 Experiments

assessing real-world scenarios. In addition, we compare our approach against existing in-
cremental learning methods using ScanNetV2 [16] in the 3DSS setting. For this evaluation,
we follow the standard training and validation splits defined in prior works [74] to ensure
consistency with existing methods. Evaluation Metrics.We evaluate our method usingMean Average Precision(mAP), a
standard metric for 3DIS which provides a comprehensive measure of segmentation quality
by accounting for both precision and recall. For comparison with existing 3DSS methods,
we report themean Intersection over Union(mIoU), which quantifies the overlap between
predicted and ground truth segments. To assess the model’s ability to mitigate catastrophic
forgetting in incremental settings, we use theForgetting Percentage Points(FPP) metric, as
defined in [47]. FPP captures performance degradation by measuring the accuracy drop on
the initially seen categories between the first and final training phases. Detailed descriptions of the incremental scenarios (Split-A,Split-B,Split-C) and im-
plementation are provided in Appendix B. 4.2 Results and Discussion

setting, as no existing incremental baselines are available for this task. In contrast, for the
3DSS setting, where incremental baselines do exist, we compare our method against three
prior approaches [43, 60, 74]. Results on CI-3DIS.Tab. 1 compares CLIMB-3D against the ER baseline across the three
CI-3DIS scenarios, evaluated after all phases using mAP 25, mAP50, overall mAP, and FPP. In theSplit-Ascenario, characterised by significant distribution shifts, our method achieves
gains of +19.23%, +16.76%, and +12.28% in mAP 25, mAP 50, and overall mAP, respec-
tively, while drastically reducing forgetting with FPP scores of 3.44% (mAP 25) and 2.63%
(mAP50), both over 45 points lower than the baseline. Under theSplit-Bscenario, with
semantically related new categories, improvements of +18.26%, +16.49%, and +12.76%
are observed alongside a reduction in forgetting to 8.00% and 5.51% from baseline levels
above 42%. For theSplit-Cscenario, featuring increasing geometric complexity, CLIMB-
3D maintains solid gains of +5.94%, +5.70%, and +4.08% across mAP metrics, with forget-
ting reduced by over 22 points. Overall, these results demonstrate robust forward transfer,
minimal forgetting, and stable learning, highlighting the method’s effectiveness for scalable
continual 3D semantic understanding. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D9

Results on CI-3DSS.Although our primary focus is on CI-3DIS, we also evaluate our
method under the CI-3DSS setting to enable comparisons with existing approaches. To do
so, we adapt our predictions to assign each point the label corresponding to the highest-
confidence mask and exclude background classes (e.g., floor and wall), as these are not part
of the semantic segmentation targets. Tab. 2 presents a comparison between our method and
existing baselines on the ScanNet V2 dataset [16], evaluated using mIoU across two training
phases and overall. Although originally designed for instance segmentation, our method
generalises effectively to semantic segmentation, achieving substantial gains of +35.23%
mIoU in Phase 1 and +19.1% in Phase 2. Overall, it achieves 59.38% mIoU, significantly
higher than the∼30% mIoU of prior methods, highlighting its robustness and transferability. Refer to Appendix C, D, and F of the supplementary material for detailed analyses of per-
phase performance, rare-class evaluation, and qualitative result comparisons, respectively. 4.3 Ablation

We conduct an ablation study to evaluate the contribution of each component in our
framework. As an upper bound, we report the performance of anOraclemodel, which is
trained jointly on the full dataset. For the incremental setting, we follow the previously
defined splits and first train the model naively across phases. We then incrementally add
each module to isolate its impact. Tab. 3 presents results for theSplit-Ascenario using both
mAP50 and FPP metrics. Naïve Training.When trained naïvely without any dedicated modules, the model suffers
from severe catastrophic forgetting, as evident in row 2. The model entirely forgets pre-
viously learned classes upon entering new phases, with performance dropping to zero for
earlier splits and FPP rising to 56.82. 10THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D
Effect of ER.Adding exemplar replay (row 3) partially alleviates forgetting by maintaining
a buffer of past examples. This yields notable gains fors1in Phase 2 (+18.51%) and Phase 3
(+10.38%), and also improvess2in Phase 3 (+9.43%). However, the overall forgetting
remains substantial (FPP: 46.44), showing ER alone is insufficient. Effect of PLG.The addition of the pseudo-label generator (PLG), which generates labels for
previous classes by retaining a copy of the model from an earlier phase, facilitates knowledge
retention and forward transfer. As shown in row 4, PLG significantly reduces forgetting and
enhances performance on current tasks. Fors1, it improves mAP 50 by 31.49% in Phase 2
and 39.40% in Phase 3 over exemplar replay. Overall, PLG yields a 15.00% increase in
performance and reduces forgetting by 39.40%. Effect of CBR.Finally, class-balanced re-weighting (CBR) mitigates class imbalance dur-
ing both pseudo-labelling and current task learning by adjusting each class’s contribution
based on its frequency. As shown in row 5, CBR enhancess1retention over PLG in Phases 2
and 3 (+4.67% and +4.41%), and further improves performance ons2ands3. It also achieves
the lowest FPP of 2.63, reflecting strong forgetting mitigation. Overall, CBR offers the best
trade-off between retaining past knowledge and acquiring new tasks, outperforming PLG
and ER by 4.41% and 43.81%, respectively. 4.4 Limitations & Future Work
While CLIMB-3D achieves strong performance across CI-3DIS and CI-3DSS settings, sev-
eral limitations remain and warrant discussion. The experiments are currently limited to
indoor datasets (ScanNet200 and ScanNetV2), therefore evaluating performance on outdoor
scenes would help assess generalisability across diverse environments. The current setup
also considers only three incremental phases, whereas real-world applications often involve
longer sequences; incorporating such extended setups would better reflect practical chal-
lenges. Moreover, the model operates in a uni-modal setting. Integrating multi-modal cues,
such as vision-language models, could further enhance performance, as suggested by recent
2D and 3D studies [25, 65, 66]. 5 Conclusion
This work addresses the challenge of catastrophic forgetting in class-incremental 3D in-
stance segmentation by introducing a modular framework that integrates exemplar replay
(ER), a pseudo-label generator (PLG), and class-balanced re-weighting (CBR). The pro-
posed method incrementally adapts to new classes while preserving prior knowledge, all
without requiring access to the full dataset. Extensive experiments on a three-phase bench-
mark validate the individual and combined effectiveness of each component: ER enables
efficient memory-based retention; PLG facilitates knowledge preservation through pseudo-
supervision; and CBR mitigates class imbalance to enhance learning stability. Together,
these components significantly reduce forgetting and improve segmentation performance
across all phases. By achieving a strong balance between stability and plasticity, our ap-
proach advances continual 3D scene understanding and sets a new baseline for future re-
search in this area. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D11

Abstract
While 3D instance segmentation (3DIS) has advanced significantly, most existing
methods assume that all object classes are known in advance and uniformly distributed. However, this assumption is unrealistic in dynamic, real-world environments where new
classes emerge gradually and exhibit natural imbalance. Although some approaches ad-
dress the emergence of new classes, they often overlook class imbalance, which leads
to suboptimal performance, particularly on rare categories. To tackle this, we propose
CLIMB-3D, a unified framework forCLass-incrementalImbalance-aware3DIS. Build-
ing upon established exemplar replay (ER) strategies, we show that ER alone is insuf-
ficient to achieve robust performance under memory constraints. To mitigate this, we
introduce a novel pseudo-label generator (PLG) that extends supervision to previously
learned categories by leveraging predictions from a frozen model trained on prior tasks. Despite its promise, PLG tends to be biased towards frequent classes. Therefore, we
propose a class-balanced re-weighting (CBR) scheme that estimates object frequencies
from pseudo-labels and dynamically adjusts training bias, without requiring access to
past data. We design and evaluate three incremental scenarios for 3DIS on the challeng-
ing ScanNet200 dataset and additionally validate our method for semantic segmentation
on ScanNetV2. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing prior work by
up to 16.76% mAP for instance segmentation and approximately 30% mIoU for semantic
segmentation, demonstrating strong generalisation across both frequent and rare classes. Code is available at:https://github.com/vgthengane/CLIMB3D. © 2025.

1 Introduction
Table Chair Couch Pillow Coffee Table Sofa Chair Recycling BinCabinet Unknown
Task-1 Task-2 Task-3
Figure 1:Overview of the CI-3DIS setting.New object categories are introduced incre-
mentally with each task. After every phase, the model must recognise both newly added
and previously learned classes. For instance, in Task 2, categories such asPillow,Coffee
Table, andSofa Chairare introduced, while the model is expected to retain recognition
of earlier classes likeTable,Chair, andCouch. 3D instance segmentation (3DIS) is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves
identifying precise object boundaries and class labels in 3D space, with broad applications in
graphics, robotics, and augmented reality [4, 39]. Traditional 3DIS methods, including top-
down [28, 70, 78], bottom-up [26, 73], and transformer-based approaches [59], perform well
under the assumption that all classes are available and balanced during training. However,
this assumption does not hold in real-world environments, where new object classes emerge
over time and exhibit natural imbalance. This gap motivates the need for Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) [17, 54], which sup-
ports learning new categories while retaining knowledge of previous ones [51]. While CIL
has seen success in 2D image tasks [1, 43, 54, 60], extensions to 3D point clouds remain
limited, often focusing on object-level classification [13, 18, 48]. Recent works on scene-
level class-incremental 3DIS (CI-3DIS) [4] and class-incremental semantic segmentation
(CI-3DSS) [74] show promise, but depend heavily on large exemplar [56] and overlook class
imbalance, limiting their practicality. To address this, we proposeCLIMB-3D, a unified framework forCLass-incremental
IMBalance-aware3DIS that jointly tackles catastrophic forgetting and class imbalance. The
framework begins with Exemplar Replay (ER), storing a small number of samples from
past classes for later replay. However, this alone does not yield promising results under the
strict memory constraints required in CI-3DIS. To address this, we introduce a Pseudo-Label
Generator (PLG), which uses a frozen model from previous task to generate supervision for
earlier classes. However, we observed that PLG tends to favour frequent classes while ig-
noring under-represented ones. To mitigate this, we propose a Class-Balanced Re-weighting
(CBR), which estimates class frequencies from the pseudo-labels to enhance the learning of
rare classes without accessing past data. Together, these components form a practical and
effective solution for real-world 3DIS. To evaluate CLIMB-3D, we designed three benchmark scenarios for CI-3DIS based on
the ScanNet200 dataset [57]. These scenarios simulate incremental learning setup under nat-
ural class imbalance, where new classes emerge based on (A) object frequency, (B) semantic
similarity, or (C) random grouping. Additionally, for comparison with existing methods,
we evaluate our approach on CI-3DSS using the ScanNetV2 dataset [16]. Experimental re-
sults show that our method significantly reduces forgetting and improves performance across
both frequent and rare categories, outperforming previous methods in both settings. Fig. 1
illustrates the CI-3DIS setup. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D3
In summary, our contributions are: (i) a novel problem setting of imbalanced class-
incremental 3DIS with an effective method to balance learning and mitigate forgetting; (ii)
three benchmarks modelling continual object emergence with natural imbalance; and (iii)
strong experimental results, achieving up to 16.76% mAP improvement over baselines. 2 Related Work
3D Instance Segmentation.Various methods have been proposed for 3DIS. Grouping-
based approaches adopt a bottom-up pipeline that learns latent embeddings for point cluster-
ing [9, 21, 22, 29, 37, 44, 70, 78]. In contrast, proposal-based methods follow a top-down
strategy by detecting 3D boxes and segmenting objects within them [19, 26, 46, 73, 76]. Recently, transformer-based models [68] have also been applied to 3DIS and 3DSS [59, 64],
inspired by advances in 2D vision [10, 11]. However, these approaches require full anno-
tations for all classes and are not designed for progressive learning, where only new class
annotations are available and previous data is inaccessible. Another line of work aims to re-
duce annotation costs by proposing weakly supervised 3DIS methods based on sparse cues
[12, 27, 72]. While effective with limited annotations, these methods assume a fixed set of
classes and are susceptible to catastrophic forgetting in incremental settings. Incremental Learning.Continual learning involves training models sequentially to miti-
gate catastrophic forgetting. One common strategy is model regularisation, which constrains
parameter updates using techniques such as elastic weight consolidation or knowledge dis-
tillation [1, 24, 35, 43, 60]. Another approach is exemplar replay, where past data is stored
or generated to rehearse older tasks while learning new ones [5, 7, 30, 54]. A third direc-
tion involves dynamically expanding the model architecture or using modular sub-networks
to accommodate new tasks without interfering with old ones [31, 42, 53, 58, 71, 79]. Re-
cent efforts in class-incremental 3D segmentation [63, 74] have shown early promise but
often rely on basic architectures and focus primarily on semantic segmentation. Other works
[4, 36] explore continual learning in 3D settings, though they often depend on large memory
buffers. In contrast, our work introduces a tailored framework for 3D instance segmentation
that effectively transfers knowledge across tasks, even under class imbalance. Long-tailed Recognition.Imbalanced class distributions lead to poor recognition of rare
(long-tail) classes. To address this, re-sampling methods balance the data via input [8, 20, 50,
52, 61] or feature space [3, 14, 40], avoiding naïve under-/over-sampling. Loss re-weighting
offers another direction, using class-based [6, 15, 23, 32, 33, 69] or per-example [45, 55, 62]
adjustments to ensure fair contribution. Parameter regularisation improves generalisation
through weight constraints [2], albeit requiring careful tuning. Other approaches leverage
transfer learning [77, 81], self-supervision [41, 75], or contrastive learning [34, 41, 82] to
improve rare-class representations. Long-tailed recognition is well-studied in 2D with large-
scale datasets [15, 49, 67]; in 3D, ScanNet200 [16, 57] enables similar efforts. Prior 3D
work focused on re-weighting, re-sampling, and transfer learning [57], while regularisation
remains underexplored. CeCo [80] balances class centres via auxiliary loss but overlooks
sampling and augmentation. Lahoud et al. [38] propose adaptive classifier regularisation
for 3D segmentation, outperforming prior approaches without threshold tuning. However,
neither method considers incremental learning. In contrast, we jointly address long-tail and
continual 3D semantic segmentation. 4THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D

Figure 2: Overview ofCLIMB-3Dfor CI-3DIS. The model incrementally learns new classes
across sequential phases. During taskt, point cloudsPand their corresponding labelsY t are
sampled from a combination of the current training datasetD t and Exemplar Replay (ER),
which maintains a small memory of past examples. These are then passed to the current
modelΦ t to produce predicted labelsY t . The Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG) selects the
top-Kpredictions from the previous modelΦ t−1 . These pseudo-labels are then weighted
based on class frequencyf(c)using Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR), and the top-Kre-
weighted labels are selected to form the balanced pseudo-label set ¯Yt . This pseudo-label set
is then concatenated with the ground-truth labels to form a final augmented supervision set
Yt for taskt, which is used to optimise the modelΦ t using Eq. (3). 3 Methodology
3.1 Problem Formulation
3DIS.The objective of this task is to detect and segment each object instance within a point
cloud. Formally, the training dataset is denoted asD={(P i,Yi)}N
i=1, whereNis the number
of training samples. Each inputP i ∈R M×6 is a coloured point cloud consisting ofMpoints,
where each point is represented by its 3D coordinates and RGB values. The corresponding
annotationY i ={(m i,j ,ci,j )}Ji
j=1 containsJ i object instances, wheremi,j ∈ {0,1}M is a binary
mask indicating which points belong to thej-th instance, andc i,j ∈ C={1,...,C}is the
semantic class label of that instance. GivenP i, the modelΦpredicts instance-level outputs
ˆYi ={(ˆmi,j ,ˆci,j )}
ˆJi
j=1, where ˆmi,j and ˆci,j denote the predicted mask and category label for
thej-th instance, respectively. The number of predicted instances ˆJi varies depending on the
model’s inference. The model is optimised using the following objective:
L3DIS(D;Φ) = 1

(mj,cj)∈Y
(Lmask(mj,ˆmj)+λ·L cls(cj,ˆcj)),(1)
whereL cls andL mask are the average classification and mask losses over all instances, andλ
controls their trade-off. CI-3DIS.Unlike conventional 3DIS, CI-3DIS involves sequential learning, where object
categories are introduced incrementally overTtraining tasks. Each tasktintroduces a dis-
joint set of classesC t , withC= ST

Overview.As shown in Fig. 2 and formulated in Sec. 3.1, the proposed framework for
CI-3DIS follows aphase-wisetraining strategy. In each phase, the model is exposed to a
carefully curated subset of the dataset, simulating real-world scenarios discussed in Sec. 3.3. Training naïvely on such phased data leads tocatastrophic forgetting[51], where the model
forgets prior knowledge when learning new tasks. To address this, we first incorporateEx-
emplar Replay(ER) [5], a strategy inspired by 2D incremental methods [1, 43, 54] and
recently extended to 3D settings [4], to mitigate forgetting by storing a small set of repre-
sentative samples from earlier phases. However, ER alone is insufficient to achieve robust
performance. To address this, two additional components are introduced: aPseudo-Label
Generator(PLG), which leverages a frozen model to generate supervision signals for previ-
ously seen classes, and aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) module that compensates for
class imbalance across phases. Each of these components is described in detail below 1. Exemplar Replay (ER).Inspired by Buzzega et al. [5], ER addresses the issue of catas-
trophic forgetting by allowing the model to retain a subset of data from earlier phases. During phaset, the model is trained not only on the current task dataD t , but also on a
set of exemplarsE 1:t−1, collected from previous phases. These exemplars are accumulated
incrementally:E 1:t−1 =E 1 ∪···∪E t−1 .Here,E t denotes the exemplar subset stored after
phaset, and|E t |denotes the exemplar replay size. The combined replay dataset is denoted
as:D t
ER =D t ∪E 1:t−1.Epoch training consists of two stages: first, the model is trained on
the current data,D t ; then it is trained using exemplars fromE 1:t−1. While previous CI-3DIS approaches rely on large exemplar sets to mitigate forgetting [4],
such strategies become impractical under memory constraints. Consequently, although ER
aids knowledge retention, it is insufficient on its own for robust performance with a limited
exemplar budget. Therefore, PLG and CBR are introduced to better preserve past represen-
tations and enhance generalisation across phases. Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG).In the CI-3DIS setting, during phaset(wheret>1),
although ground-truth labels for previously seen classes are unavailable, the model from the
previous phaseΦ t−1 , which preserves knowledge of past tasks, is retained. We use this
model to generate pseudo-labels for previously seen classes, thereby providing approximate
supervision during training. This allows the current modelΦt , to retain prior knowledge and
reduce forgetting, even without access to ground-truth annotations. Given a point cloud and label pair(P,Y t ), fromD t , the previous modelΦ t−1 , generates
pseudo-labels for the previously seen classes as ˆY1:t−1 =Φ t−1 (P), which we denote as ˜Yt
1For clarity, modifications introduced by each component (ER, PLG, and CBR) are highlighted in green, blue,
and red, respectively. 6THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D
for brevity. However, we observe that utilising all predictions fromΦt−1 introduces noisy or
incorrect labels, which degrade overall performance. To mitigate this, we select the top-K
most confident instance predictions, denoted as ˜Yt
K, and concatenate them with the ground-
truth labels of the current task to obtain the supervision set: ¯Yt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt
K. Following this,
the loss is computed over both the current task’s ground-truth labels and the top-Kconfi-
dent pseudo-labels from earlier phases, enabling the model to retain prior knowledge while
adapting to new classes. Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR).While ER and PLG contribute to preserving prior
knowledge, we observe that the model’s predictions are biased towards frequent classes,
resulting in the forgetting of rare categories. This issue is further amplified by the top-K
pseudo-labels selected by PLG, which predominantly represent dominant classes in the data. To address this, we propose aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) scheme that compensates
for class imbalance using object frequency statistics. At taskt, only the current datasetD t
and its label distributionp t (c)over classesc∈ Ct are available. Datasets and class distribu-
tions from earlier tasks{D i,p i(c)}t−1
i=1 are no longer accessible, which makes it challenging
to directly account for class imbalance across all previously seen tasks. Therefore, we pro-
pose to leverage the pseudo-label predictions of the frozen modelΦ t−1 as a proxy for the
class distribution across previously learned categories. During each training iteration, the previous modelΦ t−1 is applied to the current inputP
to generate pseudo-labels ˜Yt , from which we accumulate class-wise frequency statistics for
previously learned classes. LetC1:t = St
i=1 Ci represent the union of all classes seen up to task
t. At the end of each epoch, we compute the overall class frequencyf∈R |C1:t | by combining
the pseudo-label distribution ˜pt (c)derived from ˜Yt with the ground-truth label distribution
pt (c)from the current task. The resulting frequency vectorf= [f(c)] c∈C1:t is then used to
compute class-wise weightsw= [w(c)] c∈C1:t , which guide balanced pseudo-label selection
and help the model focus on rare classes. In the next epoch, the modelΦ t−1 produces soft pseudo-label predictions ˜Yt (as de-
scribed in PLG) , where each component ˜Yt [c]denotes the confidence score for classc∈
C1:t−1. To promote balanced pseudo-label selection, class-wise re-weighting is applied using
w(c) = 1
f(c)+ε , whereεis a small constant for numerical stability. The adjusted predictions
are computed by applying the class-wise weights as: ˜Yt,w [c] =w(c)· ˜Yt [c],∀c∈ C 1:t−1. Top-Kselection is then applied to both the original and the re-weighted scores, yielding
two pseudo-label sets: ˜Yt
K and ˜Yt,w
K , respectively. The final augmented target set, Yt , is
constructed by concatenating the ground-truth labelsY t with both sets of pseudo-labels:
Yt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt
K ∥ ˜Yt,w
K .(2)
Although the above re-weighting mitigates bias from prior tasks, it does not address class
imbalance within the current taskt. To resolve this, the class-balanced weightsw c are ex-
tended to incorporate statistics from both previously seen and current classes, i.e., overC 1:t
rather than onlyC 1:t−1. The updated weights, denoted asw ′
c, are used to re-weights both
pseudo-label selection and classification loss, ensuring balanced supervision across all seen
categories, including rare ones. This unified strategy reduces bias and enhances performance
across phases. The pseudo-code for constructing the supervision set in Eq. (2), which incor-
porates both PLG and CBR components, is provided in Appendix A. Final Objective.The final training objective ofCLIMB-3D, incorporating ER, PLG, and THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D7
CBR, is formulated in Eq. (1) as:

While CI-3DIS methods offer a wide range of practical applications, they frequently rely
on the assumption of uniform sample distribution, which rarely holds in real-world settings. In practice, the number of object categories, denoted byC, is often large and characterised
by substantial variability in category frequency, shape, structure, and size. To address these
challenges, we propose three incremental learning scenarios, each designed to capture a
different facet of real-world complexity. The design of these scenarios is detailed below; for
further information and illustrations, refer to Appendix E of the supplementary material. Split-A: Frequency Scenarios.This scenario acknowledges that datasets are often la-
belled based on the frequency of categories. To accommodate this, we propose a split where
the model learns from the most frequent categories and subsequently incorporates the less
frequent ones in later stages. By prioritising the training of frequently occurring categories,
the model can establish a strong foundation before expanding to handle rare categories. Split-B: Semantic Scenarios.Beyond frequency, semantic similarity is crucial in real-
world deployments. While objects often share visual or functional traits, models may en-
counter semantically different categories in new environments. To simulate this challenge,
we introduce theSplit-Bscenario. Here, categories are grouped based on their semantic
relationships, and the model is incrementally trained on one semantic group at a time. This
setup encourages the model to generalise across semantically similar categories and adapt
more effectively when exposed to new ones. Unlike theSplit-Ascenario, which organises
learning based on category frequency, theSplit-Bscenario may contain both frequent and
infrequent categories within a single task, focusing on semantic continuity and transfer. Split-C: Random Scenarios.In some cases, data labelling is driven by the availability of
objects rather than predefined criteria. To capture this, we introduce theSplit-Cscenario,
which represents a fully random setting where any class can appear in any task, resulting in
varying levels of class imbalance. By exposing the model to such diverse and unpredictable
distributions, we aim to improve its robustness in real-world situations where labelled data
availability is inconsistent. These incremental scenarios are designed to provide a more realistic representation of
object distributions, frequencies, and dynamics encountered in the real world. 4 Experiments

assessing real-world scenarios. In addition, we compare our approach against existing in-
cremental learning methods using ScanNetV2 [16] in the 3DSS setting. For this evaluation,
we follow the standard training and validation splits defined in prior works [74] to ensure
consistency with existing methods. Evaluation Metrics.We evaluate our method usingMean Average Precision(mAP), a
standard metric for 3DIS which provides a comprehensive measure of segmentation quality
by accounting for both precision and recall. For comparison with existing 3DSS methods,
we report themean Intersection over Union(mIoU), which quantifies the overlap between
predicted and ground truth segments. To assess the model’s ability to mitigate catastrophic
forgetting in incremental settings, we use theForgetting Percentage Points(FPP) metric, as
defined in [47]. FPP captures performance degradation by measuring the accuracy drop on
the initially seen categories between the first and final training phases. Detailed descriptions of the incremental scenarios (Split-A,Split-B,Split-C) and im-
plementation are provided in Appendix B. 4.2 Results and Discussion

To evaluate our proposed approach, we construct a baseline using ER [5] for the 3DIS
setting, as no existing incremental baselines are available for this task. In contrast, for the
3DSS setting, where incremental baselines do exist, we compare our method against three
prior approaches [43, 60, 74]. Results on CI-3DIS.Tab. 1 compares CLIMB-3D against the ER baseline across the three
CI-3DIS scenarios, evaluated after all phases using mAP 25, mAP50, overall mAP, and FPP. In theSplit-Ascenario, characterised by significant distribution shifts, our method achieves
gains of +19.23%, +16.76%, and +12.28% in mAP 25, mAP 50, and overall mAP, respec-
tively, while drastically reducing forgetting with FPP scores of 3.44% (mAP 25) and 2.63%
(mAP50), both over 45 points lower than the baseline. Under theSplit-Bscenario, with
semantically related new categories, improvements of +18.26%, +16.49%, and +12.76%
are observed alongside a reduction in forgetting to 8.00% and 5.51% from baseline levels
above 42%. For theSplit-Cscenario, featuring increasing geometric complexity, CLIMB-
3D maintains solid gains of +5.94%, +5.70%, and +4.08% across mAP metrics, with forget-
ting reduced by over 22 points. Overall, these results demonstrate robust forward transfer,
minimal forgetting, and stable learning, highlighting the method’s effectiveness for scalable
continual 3D semantic understanding. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D9

Results on CI-3DSS.Although our primary focus is on CI-3DIS, we also evaluate our
method under the CI-3DSS setting to enable comparisons with existing approaches. To do
so, we adapt our predictions to assign each point the label corresponding to the highest-
confidence mask and exclude background classes (e.g., floor and wall), as these are not part
of the semantic segmentation targets. Tab. 2 presents a comparison between our method and
existing baselines on the ScanNet V2 dataset [16], evaluated using mIoU across two training
phases and overall. Although originally designed for instance segmentation, our method
generalises effectively to semantic segmentation, achieving substantial gains of +35.23%
mIoU in Phase 1 and +19.1% in Phase 2. Overall, it achieves 59.38% mIoU, significantly
higher than the∼30% mIoU of prior methods, highlighting its robustness and transferability. Refer to Appendix C, D, and F of the supplementary material for detailed analyses of per-
phase performance, rare-class evaluation, and qualitative result comparisons, respectively. 4.3 Ablation

We conduct an ablation study to evaluate the contribution of each component in our
framework. As an upper bound, we report the performance of anOraclemodel, which is
trained jointly on the full dataset. For the incremental setting, we follow the previously
defined splits and first train the model naively across phases. We then incrementally add
each module to isolate its impact. Tab. 3 presents results for theSplit-Ascenario using both
mAP50 and FPP metrics. Naïve Training.When trained naïvely without any dedicated modules, the model suffers
from severe catastrophic forgetting, as evident in row 2. The model entirely forgets pre-
viously learned classes upon entering new phases, with performance dropping to zero for
earlier splits and FPP rising to 56.82. 10THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D
Effect of ER.Adding exemplar replay (row 3) partially alleviates forgetting by maintaining
a buffer of past examples. This yields notable gains fors1in Phase 2 (+18.51%) and Phase 3
(+10.38%), and also improvess2in Phase 3 (+9.43%). However, the overall forgetting
remains substantial (FPP: 46.44), showing ER alone is insufficient. Effect of PLG.The addition of the pseudo-label generator (PLG), which generates labels for
previous classes by retaining a copy of the model from an earlier phase, facilitates knowledge
retention and forward transfer. As shown in row 4, PLG significantly reduces forgetting and
enhances performance on current tasks. Fors1, it improves mAP 50 by 31.49% in Phase 2
and 39.40% in Phase 3 over exemplar replay. Overall, PLG yields a 15.00% increase in
performance and reduces forgetting by 39.40%. Effect of CBR.Finally, class-balanced re-weighting (CBR) mitigates class imbalance dur-
ing both pseudo-labelling and current task learning by adjusting each class’s contribution
based on its frequency. As shown in row 5, CBR enhancess1retention over PLG in Phases 2
and 3 (+4.67% and +4.41%), and further improves performance ons2ands3. It also achieves
the lowest FPP of 2.63, reflecting strong forgetting mitigation. Overall, CBR offers the best
trade-off between retaining past knowledge and acquiring new tasks, outperforming PLG
and ER by 4.41% and 43.81%, respectively. 4.4 Limitations & Future Work
While CLIMB-3D achieves strong performance across CI-3DIS and CI-3DSS settings, sev-
eral limitations remain and warrant discussion. The experiments are currently limited to
indoor datasets (ScanNet200 and ScanNetV2), therefore evaluating performance on outdoor
scenes would help assess generalisability across diverse environments. The current setup
also considers only three incremental phases, whereas real-world applications often involve
longer sequences; incorporating such extended setups would better reflect practical chal-
lenges. Moreover, the model operates in a uni-modal setting. Integrating multi-modal cues,
such as vision-language models, could further enhance performance, as suggested by recent
2D and 3D studies [25, 65, 66]. 5 Conclusion
This work addresses the challenge of catastrophic forgetting in class-incremental 3D in-
stance segmentation by introducing a modular framework that integrates exemplar replay
(ER), a pseudo-label generator (PLG), and class-balanced re-weighting (CBR). The pro-
posed method incrementally adapts to new classes while preserving prior knowledge, all
without requiring access to the full dataset. Extensive experiments on a three-phase bench-
mark validate the individual and combined effectiveness of each component: ER enables
efficient memory-based retention; PLG facilitates knowledge preservation through pseudo-
supervision; and CBR mitigates class imbalance to enhance learning stability. Together,
these components significantly reduce forgetting and improve segmentation performance
across all phases. By achieving a strong balance between stability and plasticity, our ap-
proach advances continual 3D scene understanding and sets a new baseline for future re-
search in this area. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D11

1 Introduction
Table Chair Couch Pillow Coffee Table Sofa Chair Recycling BinCabinet Unknown
Task-1 Task-2 Task-3
Figure 1:Overview of the CI-3DIS setting.New object categories are introduced incre-
mentally with each task. After every phase, the model must recognise both newly added
and previously learned classes. For instance, in Task 2, categories such asPillow,Coffee
Table, andSofa Chairare introduced, while the model is expected to retain recognition
of earlier classes likeTable,Chair, andCouch. 3D instance segmentation (3DIS) is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves
identifying precise object boundaries and class labels in 3D space, with broad applications in
graphics, robotics, and augmented reality [4, 39]. Traditional 3DIS methods, including top-
down [28, 70, 78], bottom-up [26, 73], and transformer-based approaches [59], perform well
under the assumption that all classes are available and balanced during training. However,
this assumption does not hold in real-world environments, where new object classes emerge
over time and exhibit natural imbalance. This gap motivates the need for Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) [17, 54], which sup-
ports learning new categories while retaining knowledge of previous ones [51]. While CIL
has seen success in 2D image tasks [1, 43, 54, 60], extensions to 3D point clouds remain
limited, often focusing on object-level classification [13, 18, 48]. Recent works on scene-
level class-incremental 3DIS (CI-3DIS) [4] and class-incremental semantic segmentation
(CI-3DSS) [74] show promise, but depend heavily on large exemplar [56] and overlook class
imbalance, limiting their practicality. To address this, we proposeCLIMB-3D, a unified framework forCLass-incremental
IMBalance-aware3DIS that jointly tackles catastrophic forgetting and class imbalance. The
framework begins with Exemplar Replay (ER), storing a small number of samples from
past classes for later replay. However, this alone does not yield promising results under the
strict memory constraints required in CI-3DIS. To address this, we introduce a Pseudo-Label
Generator (PLG), which uses a frozen model from previous task to generate supervision for
earlier classes. However, we observed that PLG tends to favour frequent classes while ig-
noring under-represented ones. To mitigate this, we propose a Class-Balanced Re-weighting
(CBR), which estimates class frequencies from the pseudo-labels to enhance the learning of
rare classes without accessing past data. Together, these components form a practical and
effective solution for real-world 3DIS. To evaluate CLIMB-3D, we designed three benchmark scenarios for CI-3DIS based on
the ScanNet200 dataset [57]. These scenarios simulate incremental learning setup under nat-
ural class imbalance, where new classes emerge based on (A) object frequency, (B) semantic
similarity, or (C) random grouping. Additionally, for comparison with existing methods,
we evaluate our approach on CI-3DSS using the ScanNetV2 dataset [16]. Experimental re-
sults show that our method significantly reduces forgetting and improves performance across
both frequent and rare categories, outperforming previous methods in both settings. Fig. 1

incremental 3DIS with an effective method to balance learning and mitigate forgetting; (ii)
three benchmarks modelling continual object emergence with natural imbalance; and (iii)
strong experimental results, achieving up to 16.76% mAP improvement over baselines. 2 Related Work
3D Instance Segmentation.Various methods have been proposed for 3DIS. Grouping-
based approaches adopt a bottom-up pipeline that learns latent embeddings for point cluster-
ing [9, 21, 22, 29, 37, 44, 70, 78]. In contrast, proposal-based methods follow a top-down
strategy by detecting 3D boxes and segmenting objects within them [19, 26, 46, 73, 76]. Recently, transformer-based models [68] have also been applied to 3DIS and 3DSS [59, 64],
inspired by advances in 2D vision [10, 11]. However, these approaches require full anno-
tations for all classes and are not designed for progressive learning, where only new class
annotations are available and previous data is inaccessible. Another line of work aims to re-
duce annotation costs by proposing weakly supervised 3DIS methods based on sparse cues
[12, 27, 72]. While effective with limited annotations, these methods assume a fixed set of
classes and are susceptible to catastrophic forgetting in incremental settings. Incremental Learning.Continual learning involves training models sequentially to miti-
gate catastrophic forgetting. One common strategy is model regularisation, which constrains
parameter updates using techniques such as elastic weight consolidation or knowledge dis-
tillation [1, 24, 35, 43, 60]. Another approach is exemplar replay, where past data is stored
or generated to rehearse older tasks while learning new ones [5, 7, 30, 54]. A third direc-
tion involves dynamically expanding the model architecture or using modular sub-networks
to accommodate new tasks without interfering with old ones [31, 42, 53, 58, 71, 79]. Re-
cent efforts in class-incremental 3D segmentation [63, 74] have shown early promise but
often rely on basic architectures and focus primarily on semantic segmentation. Other works
[4, 36] explore continual learning in 3D settings, though they often depend on large memory
buffers. In contrast, our work introduces a tailored framework for 3D instance segmentation
that effectively transfers knowledge across tasks, even under class imbalance. Long-tailed Recognition.Imbalanced class distributions lead to poor recognition of rare
(long-tail) classes. To address this, re-sampling methods balance the data via input [8, 20, 50,
52, 61] or feature space [3, 14, 40], avoiding naïve under-/over-sampling. Loss re-weighting
offers another direction, using class-based [6, 15, 23, 32, 33, 69] or per-example [45, 55, 62]
adjustments to ensure fair contribution. Parameter regularisation improves generalisation
through weight constraints [2], albeit requiring careful tuning. Other approaches leverage
transfer learning [77, 81], self-supervision [41, 75], or contrastive learning [34, 41, 82] to
improve rare-class representations. Long-tailed recognition is well-studied in 2D with large-
scale datasets [15, 49, 67]; in 3D, ScanNet200 [16, 57] enables similar efforts. Prior 3D
work focused on re-weighting, re-sampling, and transfer learning [57], while regularisation
remains underexplored. CeCo [80] balances class centres via auxiliary loss but overlooks
sampling and augmentation. Lahoud et al. [38] propose adaptive classifier regularisation
for 3D segmentation, outperforming prior approaches without threshold tuning. However,
neither method considers incremental learning. In contrast, we jointly address long-tail and
continual 3D semantic segmentation. 4THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D

Figure 2: Overview ofCLIMB-3Dfor CI-3DIS. The model incrementally learns new classes
across sequential phases. During taskt, point cloudsPand their corresponding labelsY t are
sampled from a combination of the current training datasetD t and Exemplar Replay (ER),
which maintains a small memory of past examples. These are then passed to the current
modelΦ t to produce predicted labelsY t . The Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG) selects the
top-Kpredictions from the previous modelΦ t−1 . These pseudo-labels are then weighted
based on class frequencyf(c)using Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR), and the top-Kre-
weighted labels are selected to form the balanced pseudo-label set ¯Yt . This pseudo-label set
is then concatenated with the ground-truth labels to form a final augmented supervision set
Yt for taskt, which is used to optimise the modelΦ t using Eq. (3). 3 Methodology
3.1 Problem Formulation
3DIS.The objective of this task is to detect and segment each object instance within a point
cloud. Formally, the training dataset is denoted asD={(P i,Yi)}N
i=1, whereNis the number
of training samples. Each inputP i ∈R M×6 is a coloured point cloud consisting ofMpoints,
where each point is represented by its 3D coordinates and RGB values. The corresponding
annotationY i ={(m i,j ,ci,j )}Ji
j=1 containsJ i object instances, wheremi,j ∈ {0,1}M is a binary
mask indicating which points belong to thej-th instance, andc i,j ∈ C={1,...,C}is the
semantic class label of that instance. GivenP i, the modelΦpredicts instance-level outputs
ˆYi ={(ˆmi,j ,ˆci,j )}
ˆJi
j=1, where ˆmi,j and ˆci,j denote the predicted mask and category label for
thej-th instance, respectively. The number of predicted instances ˆJi varies depending on the
model’s inference. The model is optimised using the following objective:
L3DIS(D;Φ) = 1

(P,Y)∈D

|Y| ∑
(mj,cj)∈Y
(Lmask(mj,ˆmj)+λ·L cls(cj,ˆcj)),(1)
whereL cls andL mask are the average classification and mask losses over all instances, andλ
controls their trade-off. CI-3DIS.Unlike conventional 3DIS, CI-3DIS involves sequential learning, where object
categories are introduced incrementally overTtraining tasks. Each tasktintroduces a dis-
joint set of classesC t , withC= ST

encountered in previous tasks, despite limited supervision and the absence of past labels. 3.2 Method: CLIMB-3D
Overview.As shown in Fig. 2 and formulated in Sec. 3.1, the proposed framework for
CI-3DIS follows aphase-wisetraining strategy. In each phase, the model is exposed to a
carefully curated subset of the dataset, simulating real-world scenarios discussed in Sec. 3.3. Training naïvely on such phased data leads tocatastrophic forgetting[51], where the model
forgets prior knowledge when learning new tasks. To address this, we first incorporateEx-
emplar Replay(ER) [5], a strategy inspired by 2D incremental methods [1, 43, 54] and
recently extended to 3D settings [4], to mitigate forgetting by storing a small set of repre-
sentative samples from earlier phases. However, ER alone is insufficient to achieve robust
performance. To address this, two additional components are introduced: aPseudo-Label
Generator(PLG), which leverages a frozen model to generate supervision signals for previ-
ously seen classes, and aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) module that compensates for
class imbalance across phases. Each of these components is described in detail below 1. Exemplar Replay (ER).Inspired by Buzzega et al. [5], ER addresses the issue of catas-
trophic forgetting by allowing the model to retain a subset of data from earlier phases. During phaset, the model is trained not only on the current task dataD t , but also on a
set of exemplarsE 1:t−1, collected from previous phases. These exemplars are accumulated
incrementally:E 1:t−1 =E 1 ∪···∪E t−1 .Here,E t denotes the exemplar subset stored after
phaset, and|E t |denotes the exemplar replay size. The combined replay dataset is denoted
as:D t
ER =D t ∪E 1:t−1.Epoch training consists of two stages: first, the model is trained on
the current data,D t ; then it is trained using exemplars fromE 1:t−1. While previous CI-3DIS approaches rely on large exemplar sets to mitigate forgetting [4],
such strategies become impractical under memory constraints. Consequently, although ER
aids knowledge retention, it is insufficient on its own for robust performance with a limited
exemplar budget. Therefore, PLG and CBR are introduced to better preserve past represen-
tations and enhance generalisation across phases. Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG).In the CI-3DIS setting, during phaset(wheret>1),
although ground-truth labels for previously seen classes are unavailable, the model from the
previous phaseΦ t−1 , which preserves knowledge of past tasks, is retained. We use this
model to generate pseudo-labels for previously seen classes, thereby providing approximate
supervision during training. This allows the current modelΦt , to retain prior knowledge and
reduce forgetting, even without access to ground-truth annotations. Given a point cloud and label pair(P,Y t ), fromD t , the previous modelΦ t−1 , generates
pseudo-labels for the previously seen classes as ˆY1:t−1 =Φ t−1 (P), which we denote as ˜Yt
1For clarity, modifications introduced by each component (ER, PLG, and CBR) are highlighted in green, blue,
and red, respectively. 6THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D
for brevity. However, we observe that utilising all predictions fromΦt−1 introduces noisy or
incorrect labels, which degrade overall performance. To mitigate this, we select the top-K
most confident instance predictions, denoted as ˜Yt
K, and concatenate them with the ground-
truth labels of the current task to obtain the supervision set: ¯Yt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt
K. Following this,
the loss is computed over both the current task’s ground-truth labels and the top-Kconfi-
dent pseudo-labels from earlier phases, enabling the model to retain prior knowledge while
adapting to new classes. Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR).While ER and PLG contribute to preserving prior
knowledge, we observe that the model’s predictions are biased towards frequent classes,
resulting in the forgetting of rare categories. This issue is further amplified by the top-K
pseudo-labels selected by PLG, which predominantly represent dominant classes in the data. To address this, we propose aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) scheme that compensates
for class imbalance using object frequency statistics. At taskt, only the current datasetD t
and its label distributionp t (c)over classesc∈ Ct are available. Datasets and class distribu-
tions from earlier tasks{D i,p i(c)}t−1
i=1 are no longer accessible, which makes it challenging
to directly account for class imbalance across all previously seen tasks. Therefore, we pro-
pose to leverage the pseudo-label predictions of the frozen modelΦ t−1 as a proxy for the
class distribution across previously learned categories. During each training iteration, the previous modelΦ t−1 is applied to the current inputP
to generate pseudo-labels ˜Yt , from which we accumulate class-wise frequency statistics for
previously learned classes. LetC1:t = St
i=1 Ci represent the union of all classes seen up to task
t. At the end of each epoch, we compute the overall class frequencyf∈R |C1:t | by combining
the pseudo-label distribution ˜pt (c)derived from ˜Yt with the ground-truth label distribution
pt (c)from the current task. The resulting frequency vectorf= [f(c)] c∈C1:t is then used to
compute class-wise weightsw= [w(c)] c∈C1:t , which guide balanced pseudo-label selection
and help the model focus on rare classes. In the next epoch, the modelΦ t−1 produces soft pseudo-label predictions ˜Yt (as de-
scribed in PLG) , where each component ˜Yt [c]denotes the confidence score for classc∈
C1:t−1. To promote balanced pseudo-label selection, class-wise re-weighting is applied using
w(c) = 1
f(c)+ε , whereεis a small constant for numerical stability. The adjusted predictions
are computed by applying the class-wise weights as: ˜Yt,w [c] =w(c)· ˜Yt [c],∀c∈ C 1:t−1. Top-Kselection is then applied to both the original and the re-weighted scores, yielding
two pseudo-label sets: ˜Yt
K and ˜Yt,w
K , respectively. The final augmented target set, Yt , is
constructed by concatenating the ground-truth labelsY t with both sets of pseudo-labels:
Yt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt
K ∥ ˜Yt,w
K .(2)
Although the above re-weighting mitigates bias from prior tasks, it does not address class
imbalance within the current taskt. To resolve this, the class-balanced weightsw c are ex-
tended to incorporate statistics from both previously seen and current classes, i.e., overC 1:t
rather than onlyC 1:t−1. The updated weights, denoted asw ′
c, are used to re-weights both
pseudo-label selection and classification loss, ensuring balanced supervision across all seen
categories, including rare ones. This unified strategy reduces bias and enhances performance
across phases. The pseudo-code for constructing the supervision set in Eq. (2), which incor-
porates both PLG and CBR components, is provided in Appendix A. Final Objective.The final training objective ofCLIMB-3D, incorporating ER, PLG, and THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D7

While CI-3DIS methods offer a wide range of practical applications, they frequently rely
on the assumption of uniform sample distribution, which rarely holds in real-world settings. In practice, the number of object categories, denoted byC, is often large and characterised
by substantial variability in category frequency, shape, structure, and size. To address these
challenges, we propose three incremental learning scenarios, each designed to capture a
different facet of real-world complexity. The design of these scenarios is detailed below; for
further information and illustrations, refer to Appendix E of the supplementary material. Split-A: Frequency Scenarios.This scenario acknowledges that datasets are often la-
belled based on the frequency of categories. To accommodate this, we propose a split where
the model learns from the most frequent categories and subsequently incorporates the less
frequent ones in later stages. By prioritising the training of frequently occurring categories,
the model can establish a strong foundation before expanding to handle rare categories. Split-B: Semantic Scenarios.Beyond frequency, semantic similarity is crucial in real-
world deployments. While objects often share visual or functional traits, models may en-
counter semantically different categories in new environments. To simulate this challenge,
we introduce theSplit-Bscenario. Here, categories are grouped based on their semantic
relationships, and the model is incrementally trained on one semantic group at a time. This
setup encourages the model to generalise across semantically similar categories and adapt
more effectively when exposed to new ones. Unlike theSplit-Ascenario, which organises
learning based on category frequency, theSplit-Bscenario may contain both frequent and
infrequent categories within a single task, focusing on semantic continuity and transfer. Split-C: Random Scenarios.In some cases, data labelling is driven by the availability of
objects rather than predefined criteria. To capture this, we introduce theSplit-Cscenario,
which represents a fully random setting where any class can appear in any task, resulting in
varying levels of class imbalance. By exposing the model to such diverse and unpredictable
distributions, we aim to improve its robustness in real-world situations where labelled data
availability is inconsistent. These incremental scenarios are designed to provide a more realistic representation of
object distributions, frequencies, and dynamics encountered in the real world. 4 Experiments

assessing real-world scenarios. In addition, we compare our approach against existing in-
cremental learning methods using ScanNetV2 [16] in the 3DSS setting. For this evaluation,
we follow the standard training and validation splits defined in prior works [74] to ensure
consistency with existing methods. Evaluation Metrics.We evaluate our method usingMean Average Precision(mAP), a
standard metric for 3DIS which provides a comprehensive measure of segmentation quality
by accounting for both precision and recall. For comparison with existing 3DSS methods,
we report themean Intersection over Union(mIoU), which quantifies the overlap between
predicted and ground truth segments. To assess the model’s ability to mitigate catastrophic
forgetting in incremental settings, we use theForgetting Percentage Points(FPP) metric, as
defined in [47]. FPP captures performance degradation by measuring the accuracy drop on
the initially seen categories between the first and final training phases. Detailed descriptions of the incremental scenarios (Split-A,Split-B,Split-C) and im-
plementation are provided in Appendix B. 4.2 Results and Discussion

To evaluate our proposed approach, we construct a baseline using ER [5] for the 3DIS
setting, as no existing incremental baselines are available for this task. In contrast, for the
3DSS setting, where incremental baselines do exist, we compare our method against three
prior approaches [43, 60, 74]. Results on CI-3DIS.Tab. 1 compares CLIMB-3D against the ER baseline across the three
CI-3DIS scenarios, evaluated after all phases using mAP 25, mAP50, overall mAP, and FPP. In theSplit-Ascenario, characterised by significant distribution shifts, our method achieves
gains of +19.23%, +16.76%, and +12.28% in mAP 25, mAP 50, and overall mAP, respec-
tively, while drastically reducing forgetting with FPP scores of 3.44% (mAP 25) and 2.63%
(mAP50), both over 45 points lower than the baseline. Under theSplit-Bscenario, with
semantically related new categories, improvements of +18.26%, +16.49%, and +12.76%
are observed alongside a reduction in forgetting to 8.00% and 5.51% from baseline levels
above 42%. For theSplit-Cscenario, featuring increasing geometric complexity, CLIMB-
3D maintains solid gains of +5.94%, +5.70%, and +4.08% across mAP metrics, with forget-
ting reduced by over 22 points. Overall, these results demonstrate robust forward transfer,
minimal forgetting, and stable learning, highlighting the method’s effectiveness for scalable
continual 3D semantic understanding. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D9

Results on CI-3DSS.Although our primary focus is on CI-3DIS, we also evaluate our
method under the CI-3DSS setting to enable comparisons with existing approaches. To do
so, we adapt our predictions to assign each point the label corresponding to the highest-
confidence mask and exclude background classes (e.g., floor and wall), as these are not part
of the semantic segmentation targets. Tab. 2 presents a comparison between our method and
existing baselines on the ScanNet V2 dataset [16], evaluated using mIoU across two training
phases and overall. Although originally designed for instance segmentation, our method
generalises effectively to semantic segmentation, achieving substantial gains of +35.23%
mIoU in Phase 1 and +19.1% in Phase 2. Overall, it achieves 59.38% mIoU, significantly
higher than the∼30% mIoU of prior methods, highlighting its robustness and transferability. Refer to Appendix C, D, and F of the supplementary material for detailed analyses of per-
phase performance, rare-class evaluation, and qualitative result comparisons, respectively. 4.3 Ablation

We conduct an ablation study to evaluate the contribution of each component in our
framework. As an upper bound, we report the performance of anOraclemodel, which is
trained jointly on the full dataset. For the incremental setting, we follow the previously
defined splits and first train the model naively across phases. We then incrementally add
each module to isolate its impact. Tab. 3 presents results for theSplit-Ascenario using both
mAP50 and FPP metrics. Naïve Training.When trained naïvely without any dedicated modules, the model suffers
from severe catastrophic forgetting, as evident in row 2. The model entirely forgets pre-
viously learned classes upon entering new phases, with performance dropping to zero for
earlier splits and FPP rising to 56.82. 10THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D
Effect of ER.Adding exemplar replay (row 3) partially alleviates forgetting by maintaining
a buffer of past examples. This yields notable gains fors1in Phase 2 (+18.51%) and Phase 3
(+10.38%), and also improvess2in Phase 3 (+9.43%). However, the overall forgetting
remains substantial (FPP: 46.44), showing ER alone is insufficient. Effect of PLG.The addition of the pseudo-label generator (PLG), which generates labels for
previous classes by retaining a copy of the model from an earlier phase, facilitates knowledge
retention and forward transfer. As shown in row 4, PLG significantly reduces forgetting and
enhances performance on current tasks. Fors1, it improves mAP 50 by 31.49% in Phase 2
and 39.40% in Phase 3 over exemplar replay. Overall, PLG yields a 15.00% increase in
performance and reduces forgetting by 39.40%. Effect of CBR.Finally, class-balanced re-weighting (CBR) mitigates class imbalance dur-
ing both pseudo-labelling and current task learning by adjusting each class’s contribution
based on its frequency. As shown in row 5, CBR enhancess1retention over PLG in Phases 2
and 3 (+4.67% and +4.41%), and further improves performance ons2ands3. It also achieves
the lowest FPP of 2.63, reflecting strong forgetting mitigation. Overall, CBR offers the best
trade-off between retaining past knowledge and acquiring new tasks, outperforming PLG
and ER by 4.41% and 43.81%, respectively. 4.4 Limitations & Future Work
While CLIMB-3D achieves strong performance across CI-3DIS and CI-3DSS settings, sev-
eral limitations remain and warrant discussion. The experiments are currently limited to
indoor datasets (ScanNet200 and ScanNetV2), therefore evaluating performance on outdoor
scenes would help assess generalisability across diverse environments. The current setup
also considers only three incremental phases, whereas real-world applications often involve
longer sequences; incorporating such extended setups would better reflect practical chal-
lenges. Moreover, the model operates in a uni-modal setting. Integrating multi-modal cues,
such as vision-language models, could further enhance performance, as suggested by recent
2D and 3D studies [25, 65, 66]. 5 Conclusion
This work addresses the challenge of catastrophic forgetting in class-incremental 3D in-
stance segmentation by introducing a modular framework that integrates exemplar replay
(ER), a pseudo-label generator (PLG), and class-balanced re-weighting (CBR). The pro-
posed method incrementally adapts to new classes while preserving prior knowledge, all
without requiring access to the full dataset. Extensive experiments on a three-phase bench-
mark validate the individual and combined effectiveness of each component: ER enables
efficient memory-based retention; PLG facilitates knowledge preservation through pseudo-
supervision; and CBR mitigates class imbalance to enhance learning stability. Together,
these components significantly reduce forgetting and improve segmentation performance
across all phases. By achieving a strong balance between stability and plasticity, our ap-
proach advances continual 3D scene understanding and sets a new baseline for future re-
search in this area. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D11

1 Introduction
Table Chair Couch Pillow Coffee Table Sofa Chair Recycling BinCabinet Unknown
Task-1 Task-2 Task-3
Figure 1:Overview of the CI-3DIS setting.New object categories are introduced incre-
mentally with each task. After every phase, the model must recognise both newly added
and previously learned classes. For instance, in Task 2, categories such asPillow,Coffee
Table, andSofa Chairare introduced, while the model is expected to retain recognition
of earlier classes likeTable,Chair, andCouch. 3D instance segmentation (3DIS) is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves
identifying precise object boundaries and class labels in 3D space, with broad applications in
graphics, robotics, and augmented reality [4, 39]. Traditional 3DIS methods, including top-
down [28, 70, 78], bottom-up [26, 73], and transformer-based approaches [59], perform well
under the assumption that all classes are available and balanced during training. However,
this assumption does not hold in real-world environments, where new object classes emerge
over time and exhibit natural imbalance. This gap motivates the need for Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) [17, 54], which sup-
ports learning new categories while retaining knowledge of previous ones [51]. While CIL
has seen success in 2D image tasks [1, 43, 54, 60], extensions to 3D point clouds remain
limited, often focusing on object-level classification [13, 18, 48]. Recent works on scene-
level class-incremental 3DIS (CI-3DIS) [4] and class-incremental semantic segmentation
(CI-3DSS) [74] show promise, but depend heavily on large exemplar [56] and overlook class
imbalance, limiting their practicality. To address this, we proposeCLIMB-3D, a unified framework forCLass-incremental
IMBalance-aware3DIS that jointly tackles catastrophic forgetting and class imbalance. The
framework begins with Exemplar Replay (ER), storing a small number of samples from
past classes for later replay. However, this alone does not yield promising results under the
strict memory constraints required in CI-3DIS. To address this, we introduce a Pseudo-Label
Generator (PLG), which uses a frozen model from previous task to generate supervision for
earlier classes. However, we observed that PLG tends to favour frequent classes while ig-
noring under-represented ones. To mitigate this, we propose a Class-Balanced Re-weighting
(CBR), which estimates class frequencies from the pseudo-labels to enhance the learning of
rare classes without accessing past data. Together, these components form a practical and
effective solution for real-world 3DIS. To evaluate CLIMB-3D, we designed three benchmark scenarios for CI-3DIS based on
the ScanNet200 dataset [57]. These scenarios simulate incremental learning setup under nat-
ural class imbalance, where new classes emerge based on (A) object frequency, (B) semantic
similarity, or (C) random grouping. Additionally, for comparison with existing methods,
we evaluate our approach on CI-3DSS using the ScanNetV2 dataset [16]. Experimental re-
sults show that our method significantly reduces forgetting and improves performance across
both frequent and rare categories, outperforming previous methods in both settings. Fig. 1
illustrates the CI-3DIS setup. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D3
In summary, our contributions are: (i) a novel problem setting of imbalanced class-
incremental 3DIS with an effective method to balance learning and mitigate forgetting; (ii)
three benchmarks modelling continual object emergence with natural imbalance; and (iii)
strong experimental results, achieving up to 16.76% mAP improvement over baselines. 2 Related Work
3D Instance Segmentation.Various methods have been proposed for 3DIS. Grouping-
based approaches adopt a bottom-up pipeline that learns latent embeddings for point cluster-
ing [9, 21, 22, 29, 37, 44, 70, 78]. In contrast, proposal-based methods follow a top-down
strategy by detecting 3D boxes and segmenting objects within them [19, 26, 46, 73, 76]. Recently, transformer-based models [68] have also been applied to 3DIS and 3DSS [59, 64],
inspired by advances in 2D vision [10, 11]. However, these approaches require full anno-
tations for all classes and are not designed for progressive learning, where only new class
annotations are available and previous data is inaccessible. Another line of work aims to re-
duce annotation costs by proposing weakly supervised 3DIS methods based on sparse cues
[12, 27, 72]. While effective with limited annotations, these methods assume a fixed set of
classes and are susceptible to catastrophic forgetting in incremental settings. Incremental Learning.Continual learning involves training models sequentially to miti-
gate catastrophic forgetting. One common strategy is model regularisation, which constrains
parameter updates using techniques such as elastic weight consolidation or knowledge dis-
tillation [1, 24, 35, 43, 60]. Another approach is exemplar replay, where past data is stored
or generated to rehearse older tasks while learning new ones [5, 7, 30, 54]. A third direc-
tion involves dynamically expanding the model architecture or using modular sub-networks
to accommodate new tasks without interfering with old ones [31, 42, 53, 58, 71, 79]. Re-
cent efforts in class-incremental 3D segmentation [63, 74] have shown early promise but
often rely on basic architectures and focus primarily on semantic segmentation. Other works
[4, 36] explore continual learning in 3D settings, though they often depend on large memory
buffers. In contrast, our work introduces a tailored framework for 3D instance segmentation
that effectively transfers knowledge across tasks, even under class imbalance. Long-tailed Recognition.Imbalanced class distributions lead to poor recognition of rare
(long-tail) classes. To address this, re-sampling methods balance the data via input [8, 20, 50,
52, 61] or feature space [3, 14, 40], avoiding naïve under-/over-sampling. Loss re-weighting
offers another direction, using class-based [6, 15, 23, 32, 33, 69] or per-example [45, 55, 62]
adjustments to ensure fair contribution. Parameter regularisation improves generalisation
through weight constraints [2], albeit requiring careful tuning. Other approaches leverage
transfer learning [77, 81], self-supervision [41, 75], or contrastive learning [34, 41, 82] to
improve rare-class representations. Long-tailed recognition is well-studied in 2D with large-
scale datasets [15, 49, 67]; in 3D, ScanNet200 [16, 57] enables similar efforts. Prior 3D
work focused on re-weighting, re-sampling, and transfer learning [57], while regularisation
remains underexplored. CeCo [80] balances class centres via auxiliary loss but overlooks
sampling and augmentation. Lahoud et al. [38] propose adaptive classifier regularisation
for 3D segmentation, outperforming prior approaches without threshold tuning. However,
neither method considers incremental learning. In contrast, we jointly address long-tail and
continual 3D semantic segmentation. 4THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D

Figure 2: Overview ofCLIMB-3Dfor CI-3DIS. The model incrementally learns new classes
across sequential phases. During taskt, point cloudsPand their corresponding labelsY t are
sampled from a combination of the current training datasetD t and Exemplar Replay (ER),
which maintains a small memory of past examples. These are then passed to the current
modelΦ t to produce predicted labelsY t . The Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG) selects the
top-Kpredictions from the previous modelΦ t−1 . These pseudo-labels are then weighted
based on class frequencyf(c)using Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR), and the top-Kre-
weighted labels are selected to form the balanced pseudo-label set ¯Yt . This pseudo-label set
is then concatenated with the ground-truth labels to form a final augmented supervision set
Yt for taskt, which is used to optimise the modelΦ t using Eq. (3). 3 Methodology
3.1 Problem Formulation
3DIS.The objective of this task is to detect and segment each object instance within a point
cloud. Formally, the training dataset is denoted asD={(P i,Yi)}N
i=1, whereNis the number
of training samples. Each inputP i ∈R M×6 is a coloured point cloud consisting ofMpoints,
where each point is represented by its 3D coordinates and RGB values. The corresponding
annotationY i ={(m i,j ,ci,j )}Ji
j=1 containsJ i object instances, wheremi,j ∈ {0,1}M is a binary
mask indicating which points belong to thej-th instance, andc i,j ∈ C={1,...,C}is the
semantic class label of that instance. GivenP i, the modelΦpredicts instance-level outputs
ˆYi ={(ˆmi,j ,ˆci,j )}
ˆJi
j=1, where ˆmi,j and ˆci,j denote the predicted mask and category label for
thej-th instance, respectively. The number of predicted instances ˆJi varies depending on the
model’s inference. The model is optimised using the following objective:
L3DIS(D;Φ) = 1

(mj,cj)∈Y

whereL cls andL mask are the average classification and mask losses over all instances, andλ
controls their trade-off. CI-3DIS.Unlike conventional 3DIS, CI-3DIS involves sequential learning, where object
categories are introduced incrementally overTtraining tasks. Each tasktintroduces a dis-
joint set of classesC t , withC= ST

Overview.As shown in Fig. 2 and formulated in Sec. 3.1, the proposed framework for
CI-3DIS follows aphase-wisetraining strategy. In each phase, the model is exposed to a
carefully curated subset of the dataset, simulating real-world scenarios discussed in Sec. 3.3. Training naïvely on such phased data leads tocatastrophic forgetting[51], where the model
forgets prior knowledge when learning new tasks. To address this, we first incorporateEx-
emplar Replay(ER) [5], a strategy inspired by 2D incremental methods [1, 43, 54] and
recently extended to 3D settings [4], to mitigate forgetting by storing a small set of repre-
sentative samples from earlier phases. However, ER alone is insufficient to achieve robust
performance. To address this, two additional components are introduced: aPseudo-Label
Generator(PLG), which leverages a frozen model to generate supervision signals for previ-
ously seen classes, and aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) module that compensates for
class imbalance across phases. Each of these components is described in detail below 1. Exemplar Replay (ER).Inspired by Buzzega et al. [5], ER addresses the issue of catas-
trophic forgetting by allowing the model to retain a subset of data from earlier phases. During phaset, the model is trained not only on the current task dataD t , but also on a
set of exemplarsE 1:t−1, collected from previous phases. These exemplars are accumulated
incrementally:E 1:t−1 =E 1 ∪···∪E t−1 .Here,E t denotes the exemplar subset stored after
phaset, and|E t |denotes the exemplar replay size. The combined replay dataset is denoted
as:D t
ER =D t ∪E 1:t−1.Epoch training consists of two stages: first, the model is trained on
the current data,D t ; then it is trained using exemplars fromE 1:t−1. While previous CI-3DIS approaches rely on large exemplar sets to mitigate forgetting [4],
such strategies become impractical under memory constraints. Consequently, although ER
aids knowledge retention, it is insufficient on its own for robust performance with a limited
exemplar budget. Therefore, PLG and CBR are introduced to better preserve past represen-
tations and enhance generalisation across phases. Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG).In the CI-3DIS setting, during phaset(wheret>1),
although ground-truth labels for previously seen classes are unavailable, the model from the
previous phaseΦ t−1 , which preserves knowledge of past tasks, is retained. We use this
model to generate pseudo-labels for previously seen classes, thereby providing approximate
supervision during training. This allows the current modelΦt , to retain prior knowledge and
reduce forgetting, even without access to ground-truth annotations. Given a point cloud and label pair(P,Y t ), fromD t , the previous modelΦ t−1 , generates
pseudo-labels for the previously seen classes as ˆY1:t−1 =Φ t−1 (P), which we denote as ˜Yt
1For clarity, modifications introduced by each component (ER, PLG, and CBR) are highlighted in green, blue,
and red, respectively. 6THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D
for brevity. However, we observe that utilising all predictions fromΦt−1 introduces noisy or
incorrect labels, which degrade overall performance. To mitigate this, we select the top-K
most confident instance predictions, denoted as ˜Yt
K, and concatenate them with the ground-
truth labels of the current task to obtain the supervision set: ¯Yt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt
K. Following this,
the loss is computed over both the current task’s ground-truth labels and the top-Kconfi-
dent pseudo-labels from earlier phases, enabling the model to retain prior knowledge while
adapting to new classes. Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR).While ER and PLG contribute to preserving prior
knowledge, we observe that the model’s predictions are biased towards frequent classes,
resulting in the forgetting of rare categories. This issue is further amplified by the top-K
pseudo-labels selected by PLG, which predominantly represent dominant classes in the data. To address this, we propose aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) scheme that compensates
for class imbalance using object frequency statistics. At taskt, only the current datasetD t
and its label distributionp t (c)over classesc∈ Ct are available. Datasets and class distribu-
tions from earlier tasks{D i,p i(c)}t−1
i=1 are no longer accessible, which makes it challenging
to directly account for class imbalance across all previously seen tasks. Therefore, we pro-
pose to leverage the pseudo-label predictions of the frozen modelΦ t−1 as a proxy for the
class distribution across previously learned categories. During each training iteration, the previous modelΦ t−1 is applied to the current inputP
to generate pseudo-labels ˜Yt , from which we accumulate class-wise frequency statistics for
previously learned classes. LetC1:t = St
i=1 Ci represent the union of all classes seen up to task
t. At the end of each epoch, we compute the overall class frequencyf∈R |C1:t | by combining
the pseudo-label distribution ˜pt (c)derived from ˜Yt with the ground-truth label distribution
pt (c)from the current task. The resulting frequency vectorf= [f(c)] c∈C1:t is then used to
compute class-wise weightsw= [w(c)] c∈C1:t , which guide balanced pseudo-label selection
and help the model focus on rare classes. In the next epoch, the modelΦ t−1 produces soft pseudo-label predictions ˜Yt (as de-
scribed in PLG) , where each component ˜Yt [c]denotes the confidence score for classc∈
C1:t−1. To promote balanced pseudo-label selection, class-wise re-weighting is applied using
w(c) = 1
f(c)+ε , whereεis a small constant for numerical stability. The adjusted predictions
are computed by applying the class-wise weights as: ˜Yt,w [c] =w(c)· ˜Yt [c],∀c∈ C 1:t−1. Top-Kselection is then applied to both the original and the re-weighted scores, yielding
two pseudo-label sets: ˜Yt
K and ˜Yt,w
K , respectively. The final augmented target set, Yt , is
constructed by concatenating the ground-truth labelsY t with both sets of pseudo-labels:
Yt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt
K ∥ ˜Yt,w
K .(2)
Although the above re-weighting mitigates bias from prior tasks, it does not address class
imbalance within the current taskt. To resolve this, the class-balanced weightsw c are ex-
tended to incorporate statistics from both previously seen and current classes, i.e., overC 1:t
rather than onlyC 1:t−1. The updated weights, denoted asw ′
c, are used to re-weights both
pseudo-label selection and classification loss, ensuring balanced supervision across all seen
categories, including rare ones. This unified strategy reduces bias and enhances performance
across phases. The pseudo-code for constructing the supervision set in Eq. (2), which incor-
porates both PLG and CBR components, is provided in Appendix A. Final Objective.The final training objective ofCLIMB-3D, incorporating ER, PLG, and THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D7

While CI-3DIS methods offer a wide range of practical applications, they frequently rely
on the assumption of uniform sample distribution, which rarely holds in real-world settings. In practice, the number of object categories, denoted byC, is often large and characterised
by substantial variability in category frequency, shape, structure, and size. To address these
challenges, we propose three incremental learning scenarios, each designed to capture a
different facet of real-world complexity. The design of these scenarios is detailed below; for
further information and illustrations, refer to Appendix E of the supplementary material. Split-A: Frequency Scenarios.This scenario acknowledges that datasets are often la-
belled based on the frequency of categories. To accommodate this, we propose a split where
the model learns from the most frequent categories and subsequently incorporates the less
frequent ones in later stages. By prioritising the training of frequently occurring categories,
the model can establish a strong foundation before expanding to handle rare categories. Split-B: Semantic Scenarios.Beyond frequency, semantic similarity is crucial in real-
world deployments. While objects often share visual or functional traits, models may en-
counter semantically different categories in new environments. To simulate this challenge,
we introduce theSplit-Bscenario. Here, categories are grouped based on their semantic
relationships, and the model is incrementally trained on one semantic group at a time. This
setup encourages the model to generalise across semantically similar categories and adapt
more effectively when exposed to new ones. Unlike theSplit-Ascenario, which organises
learning based on category frequency, theSplit-Bscenario may contain both frequent and
infrequent categories within a single task, focusing on semantic continuity and transfer. Split-C: Random Scenarios.In some cases, data labelling is driven by the availability of
objects rather than predefined criteria. To capture this, we introduce theSplit-Cscenario,
which represents a fully random setting where any class can appear in any task, resulting in
varying levels of class imbalance. By exposing the model to such diverse and unpredictable
distributions, we aim to improve its robustness in real-world situations where labelled data
availability is inconsistent. These incremental scenarios are designed to provide a more realistic representation of
object distributions, frequencies, and dynamics encountered in the real world. 4 Experiments

assessing real-world scenarios. In addition, we compare our approach against existing in-
cremental learning methods using ScanNetV2 [16] in the 3DSS setting. For this evaluation,
we follow the standard training and validation splits defined in prior works [74] to ensure
consistency with existing methods. Evaluation Metrics.We evaluate our method usingMean Average Precision(mAP), a
standard metric for 3DIS which provides a comprehensive measure of segmentation quality
by accounting for both precision and recall. For comparison with existing 3DSS methods,
we report themean Intersection over Union(mIoU), which quantifies the overlap between
predicted and ground truth segments. To assess the model’s ability to mitigate catastrophic
forgetting in incremental settings, we use theForgetting Percentage Points(FPP) metric, as
defined in [47]. FPP captures performance degradation by measuring the accuracy drop on
the initially seen categories between the first and final training phases. Detailed descriptions of the incremental scenarios (Split-A,Split-B,Split-C) and im-
plementation are provided in Appendix B. 4.2 Results and Discussion

To evaluate our proposed approach, we construct a baseline using ER [5] for the 3DIS
setting, as no existing incremental baselines are available for this task. In contrast, for the
3DSS setting, where incremental baselines do exist, we compare our method against three
prior approaches [43, 60, 74]. Results on CI-3DIS.Tab. 1 compares CLIMB-3D against the ER baseline across the three
CI-3DIS scenarios, evaluated after all phases using mAP 25, mAP50, overall mAP, and FPP. In theSplit-Ascenario, characterised by significant distribution shifts, our method achieves
gains of +19.23%, +16.76%, and +12.28% in mAP 25, mAP 50, and overall mAP, respec-
tively, while drastically reducing forgetting with FPP scores of 3.44% (mAP 25) and 2.63%
(mAP50), both over 45 points lower than the baseline. Under theSplit-Bscenario, with
semantically related new categories, improvements of +18.26%, +16.49%, and +12.76%
are observed alongside a reduction in forgetting to 8.00% and 5.51% from baseline levels
above 42%. For theSplit-Cscenario, featuring increasing geometric complexity, CLIMB-
3D maintains solid gains of +5.94%, +5.70%, and +4.08% across mAP metrics, with forget-
ting reduced by over 22 points. Overall, these results demonstrate robust forward transfer,
minimal forgetting, and stable learning, highlighting the method’s effectiveness for scalable
continual 3D semantic understanding. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D9

Results on CI-3DSS.Although our primary focus is on CI-3DIS, we also evaluate our
method under the CI-3DSS setting to enable comparisons with existing approaches. To do
so, we adapt our predictions to assign each point the label corresponding to the highest-
confidence mask and exclude background classes (e.g., floor and wall), as these are not part
of the semantic segmentation targets. Tab. 2 presents a comparison between our method and
existing baselines on the ScanNet V2 dataset [16], evaluated using mIoU across two training
phases and overall. Although originally designed for instance segmentation, our method
generalises effectively to semantic segmentation, achieving substantial gains of +35.23%
mIoU in Phase 1 and +19.1% in Phase 2. Overall, it achieves 59.38% mIoU, significantly
higher than the∼30% mIoU of prior methods, highlighting its robustness and transferability. Refer to Appendix C, D, and F of the supplementary material for detailed analyses of per-
phase performance, rare-class evaluation, and qualitative result comparisons, respectively. 4.3 Ablation

We conduct an ablation study to evaluate the contribution of each component in our
framework. As an upper bound, we report the performance of anOraclemodel, which is
trained jointly on the full dataset. For the incremental setting, we follow the previously
defined splits and first train the model naively across phases. We then incrementally add
each module to isolate its impact. Tab. 3 presents results for theSplit-Ascenario using both
mAP50 and FPP metrics. Naïve Training.When trained naïvely without any dedicated modules, the model suffers
from severe catastrophic forgetting, as evident in row 2. The model entirely forgets pre-
viously learned classes upon entering new phases, with performance dropping to zero for
earlier splits and FPP rising to 56.82. 10THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D
Effect of ER.Adding exemplar replay (row 3) partially alleviates forgetting by maintaining
a buffer of past examples. This yields notable gains fors1in Phase 2 (+18.51%) and Phase 3
(+10.38%), and also improvess2in Phase 3 (+9.43%). However, the overall forgetting
remains substantial (FPP: 46.44), showing ER alone is insufficient. Effect of PLG.The addition of the pseudo-label generator (PLG), which generates labels for
previous classes by retaining a copy of the model from an earlier phase, facilitates knowledge
retention and forward transfer. As shown in row 4, PLG significantly reduces forgetting and
enhances performance on current tasks. Fors1, it improves mAP 50 by 31.49% in Phase 2
and 39.40% in Phase 3 over exemplar replay. Overall, PLG yields a 15.00% increase in
performance and reduces forgetting by 39.40%. Effect of CBR.Finally, class-balanced re-weighting (CBR) mitigates class imbalance dur-
ing both pseudo-labelling and current task learning by adjusting each class’s contribution
based on its frequency. As shown in row 5, CBR enhancess1retention over PLG in Phases 2
and 3 (+4.67% and +4.41%), and further improves performance ons2ands3. It also achieves
the lowest FPP of 2.63, reflecting strong forgetting mitigation. Overall, CBR offers the best
trade-off between retaining past knowledge and acquiring new tasks, outperforming PLG
and ER by 4.41% and 43.81%, respectively. 4.4 Limitations & Future Work
While CLIMB-3D achieves strong performance across CI-3DIS and CI-3DSS settings, sev-
eral limitations remain and warrant discussion. The experiments are currently limited to
indoor datasets (ScanNet200 and ScanNetV2), therefore evaluating performance on outdoor
scenes would help assess generalisability across diverse environments. The current setup
also considers only three incremental phases, whereas real-world applications often involve
longer sequences; incorporating such extended setups would better reflect practical chal-
lenges. Moreover, the model operates in a uni-modal setting. Integrating multi-modal cues,
such as vision-language models, could further enhance performance, as suggested by recent
2D and 3D studies [25, 65, 66]. 5 Conclusion
This work addresses the challenge of catastrophic forgetting in class-incremental 3D in-
stance segmentation by introducing a modular framework that integrates exemplar replay
(ER), a pseudo-label generator (PLG), and class-balanced re-weighting (CBR). The pro-
posed method incrementally adapts to new classes while preserving prior knowledge, all
without requiring access to the full dataset. Extensive experiments on a three-phase bench-
mark validate the individual and combined effectiveness of each component: ER enables
efficient memory-based retention; PLG facilitates knowledge preservation through pseudo-
supervision; and CBR mitigates class imbalance to enhance learning stability. Together,
these components significantly reduce forgetting and improve segmentation performance
across all phases. By achieving a strong balance between stability and plasticity, our ap-
proach advances continual 3D scene understanding and sets a new baseline for future re-
search in this area. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D11

Abstract
While 3D instance segmentation (3DIS) has advanced significantly, most existing
methods assume that all object classes are known in advance and uniformly distributed. However, this assumption is unrealistic in dynamic, real-world environments where new
classes emerge gradually and exhibit natural imbalance. Although some approaches ad-
dress the emergence of new classes, they often overlook class imbalance, which leads
to suboptimal performance, particularly on rare categories. To tackle this, we propose
CLIMB-3D, a unified framework forCLass-incrementalImbalance-aware3DIS. Build-
ing upon established exemplar replay (ER) strategies, we show that ER alone is insuf-
ficient to achieve robust performance under memory constraints. To mitigate this, we
introduce a novel pseudo-label generator (PLG) that extends supervision to previously
learned categories by leveraging predictions from a frozen model trained on prior tasks. Despite its promise, PLG tends to be biased towards frequent classes. Therefore, we
propose a class-balanced re-weighting (CBR) scheme that estimates object frequencies
from pseudo-labels and dynamically adjusts training bias, without requiring access to
past data. We design and evaluate three incremental scenarios for 3DIS on the challeng-
ing ScanNet200 dataset and additionally validate our method for semantic segmentation
on ScanNetV2. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing prior work by
up to 16.76% mAP for instance segmentation and approximately 30% mIoU for semantic
segmentation, demonstrating strong generalisation across both frequent and rare classes. Code is available at:https://github.com/vgthengane/CLIMB3D. © 2025.

Task-1 Task-2 Task-3
Figure 1:Overview of the CI-3DIS setting.New object categories are introduced incre-
mentally with each task. After every phase, the model must recognise both newly added
and previously learned classes. For instance, in Task 2, categories such asPillow,Coffee
Table, andSofa Chairare introduced, while the model is expected to retain recognition
of earlier classes likeTable,Chair, andCouch. 3D instance segmentation (3DIS) is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves
identifying precise object boundaries and class labels in 3D space, with broad applications in
graphics, robotics, and augmented reality [4, 39]. Traditional 3DIS methods, including top-
down [28, 70, 78], bottom-up [26, 73], and transformer-based approaches [59], perform well
under the assumption that all classes are available and balanced during training. However,
this assumption does not hold in real-world environments, where new object classes emerge
over time and exhibit natural imbalance. This gap motivates the need for Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) [17, 54], which sup-
ports learning new categories while retaining knowledge of previous ones [51]. While CIL
has seen success in 2D image tasks [1, 43, 54, 60], extensions to 3D point clouds remain
limited, often focusing on object-level classification [13, 18, 48]. Recent works on scene-
level class-incremental 3DIS (CI-3DIS) [4] and class-incremental semantic segmentation
(CI-3DSS) [74] show promise, but depend heavily on large exemplar [56] and overlook class
imbalance, limiting their practicality. To address this, we proposeCLIMB-3D, a unified framework forCLass-incremental
IMBalance-aware3DIS that jointly tackles catastrophic forgetting and class imbalance. The
framework begins with Exemplar Replay (ER), storing a small number of samples from
past classes for later replay. However, this alone does not yield promising results under the
strict memory constraints required in CI-3DIS. To address this, we introduce a Pseudo-Label
Generator (PLG), which uses a frozen model from previous task to generate supervision for
earlier classes. However, we observed that PLG tends to favour frequent classes while ig-
noring under-represented ones. To mitigate this, we propose a Class-Balanced Re-weighting
(CBR), which estimates class frequencies from the pseudo-labels to enhance the learning of
rare classes without accessing past data. Together, these components form a practical and
effective solution for real-world 3DIS. To evaluate CLIMB-3D, we designed three benchmark scenarios for CI-3DIS based on
the ScanNet200 dataset [57]. These scenarios simulate incremental learning setup under nat-
ural class imbalance, where new classes emerge based on (A) object frequency, (B) semantic
similarity, or (C) random grouping. Additionally, for comparison with existing methods,
we evaluate our approach on CI-3DSS using the ScanNetV2 dataset [16]. Experimental re-
sults show that our method significantly reduces forgetting and improves performance across
both frequent and rare categories, outperforming previous methods in both settings. Fig. 1
illustrates the CI-3DIS setup. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D3
In summary, our contributions are: (i) a novel problem setting of imbalanced class-
incremental 3DIS with an effective method to balance learning and mitigate forgetting; (ii)
three benchmarks modelling continual object emergence with natural imbalance; and (iii)
strong experimental results, achieving up to 16.76% mAP improvement over baselines. 2 Related Work
3D Instance Segmentation.Various methods have been proposed for 3DIS. Grouping-
based approaches adopt a bottom-up pipeline that learns latent embeddings for point cluster-
ing [9, 21, 22, 29, 37, 44, 70, 78]. In contrast, proposal-based methods follow a top-down
strategy by detecting 3D boxes and segmenting objects within them [19, 26, 46, 73, 76]. Recently, transformer-based models [68] have also been applied to 3DIS and 3DSS [59, 64],
inspired by advances in 2D vision [10, 11]. However, these approaches require full anno-
tations for all classes and are not designed for progressive learning, where only new class
annotations are available and previous data is inaccessible. Another line of work aims to re-
duce annotation costs by proposing weakly supervised 3DIS methods based on sparse cues
[12, 27, 72]. While effective with limited annotations, these methods assume a fixed set of
classes and are susceptible to catastrophic forgetting in incremental settings. Incremental Learning.Continual learning involves training models sequentially to miti-
gate catastrophic forgetting. One common strategy is model regularisation, which constrains
parameter updates using techniques such as elastic weight consolidation or knowledge dis-
tillation [1, 24, 35, 43, 60]. Another approach is exemplar replay, where past data is stored
or generated to rehearse older tasks while learning new ones [5, 7, 30, 54]. A third direc-
tion involves dynamically expanding the model architecture or using modular sub-networks
to accommodate new tasks without interfering with old ones [31, 42, 53, 58, 71, 79]. Re-
cent efforts in class-incremental 3D segmentation [63, 74] have shown early promise but
often rely on basic architectures and focus primarily on semantic segmentation. Other works
[4, 36] explore continual learning in 3D settings, though they often depend on large memory
buffers. In contrast, our work introduces a tailored framework for 3D instance segmentation
that effectively transfers knowledge across tasks, even under class imbalance. Long-tailed Recognition.Imbalanced class distributions lead to poor recognition of rare
(long-tail) classes. To address this, re-sampling methods balance the data via input [8, 20, 50,
52, 61] or feature space [3, 14, 40], avoiding naïve under-/over-sampling. Loss re-weighting
offers another direction, using class-based [6, 15, 23, 32, 33, 69] or per-example [45, 55, 62]
adjustments to ensure fair contribution. Parameter regularisation improves generalisation
through weight constraints [2], albeit requiring careful tuning. Other approaches leverage
transfer learning [77, 81], self-supervision [41, 75], or contrastive learning [34, 41, 82] to
improve rare-class representations. Long-tailed recognition is well-studied in 2D with large-
scale datasets [15, 49, 67]; in 3D, ScanNet200 [16, 57] enables similar efforts. Prior 3D
work focused on re-weighting, re-sampling, and transfer learning [57], while regularisation
remains underexplored. CeCo [80] balances class centres via auxiliary loss but overlooks
sampling and augmentation. Lahoud et al. [38] propose adaptive classifier regularisation
for 3D segmentation, outperforming prior approaches without threshold tuning. However,
neither method considers incremental learning. In contrast, we jointly address long-tail and
continual 3D semantic segmentation. 4THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D

Figure 2: Overview ofCLIMB-3Dfor CI-3DIS. The model incrementally learns new classes
across sequential phases. During taskt, point cloudsPand their corresponding labelsY t are
sampled from a combination of the current training datasetD t and Exemplar Replay (ER),
which maintains a small memory of past examples. These are then passed to the current
modelΦ t to produce predicted labelsY t . The Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG) selects the
top-Kpredictions from the previous modelΦ t−1 . These pseudo-labels are then weighted
based on class frequencyf(c)using Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR), and the top-Kre-
weighted labels are selected to form the balanced pseudo-label set ¯Yt . This pseudo-label set
is then concatenated with the ground-truth labels to form a final augmented supervision set
Yt for taskt, which is used to optimise the modelΦ t using Eq. (3). 3 Methodology
3.1 Problem Formulation
3DIS.The objective of this task is to detect and segment each object instance within a point
cloud. Formally, the training dataset is denoted asD={(P i,Yi)}N
i=1, whereNis the number
of training samples. Each inputP i ∈R M×6 is a coloured point cloud consisting ofMpoints,
where each point is represented by its 3D coordinates and RGB values. The corresponding
annotationY i ={(m i,j ,ci,j )}Ji
j=1 containsJ i object instances, wheremi,j ∈ {0,1}M is a binary
mask indicating which points belong to thej-th instance, andc i,j ∈ C={1,...,C}is the
semantic class label of that instance. GivenP i, the modelΦpredicts instance-level outputs
ˆYi ={(ˆmi,j ,ˆci,j )}
ˆJi
j=1, where ˆmi,j and ˆci,j denote the predicted mask and category label for
thej-th instance, respectively. The number of predicted instances ˆJi varies depending on the
model’s inference. The model is optimised using the following objective:
L3DIS(D;Φ) = 1

whereL cls andL mask are the average classification and mask losses over all instances, andλ
controls their trade-off. CI-3DIS.Unlike conventional 3DIS, CI-3DIS involves sequential learning, where object
categories are introduced incrementally overTtraining tasks. Each tasktintroduces a dis-
joint set of classesC t , withC= ST

Overview.As shown in Fig. 2 and formulated in Sec. 3.1, the proposed framework for
CI-3DIS follows aphase-wisetraining strategy. In each phase, the model is exposed to a
carefully curated subset of the dataset, simulating real-world scenarios discussed in Sec. 3.3. Training naïvely on such phased data leads tocatastrophic forgetting[51], where the model
forgets prior knowledge when learning new tasks. To address this, we first incorporateEx-
emplar Replay(ER) [5], a strategy inspired by 2D incremental methods [1, 43, 54] and
recently extended to 3D settings [4], to mitigate forgetting by storing a small set of repre-
sentative samples from earlier phases. However, ER alone is insufficient to achieve robust
performance. To address this, two additional components are introduced: aPseudo-Label
Generator(PLG), which leverages a frozen model to generate supervision signals for previ-
ously seen classes, and aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) module that compensates for
class imbalance across phases. Each of these components is described in detail below 1. Exemplar Replay (ER).Inspired by Buzzega et al. [5], ER addresses the issue of catas-
trophic forgetting by allowing the model to retain a subset of data from earlier phases. During phaset, the model is trained not only on the current task dataD t , but also on a
set of exemplarsE 1:t−1, collected from previous phases. These exemplars are accumulated
incrementally:E 1:t−1 =E 1 ∪···∪E t−1 .Here,E t denotes the exemplar subset stored after
phaset, and|E t |denotes the exemplar replay size. The combined replay dataset is denoted
as:D t
ER =D t ∪E 1:t−1.Epoch training consists of two stages: first, the model is trained on
the current data,D t ; then it is trained using exemplars fromE 1:t−1. While previous CI-3DIS approaches rely on large exemplar sets to mitigate forgetting [4],
such strategies become impractical under memory constraints. Consequently, although ER
aids knowledge retention, it is insufficient on its own for robust performance with a limited
exemplar budget. Therefore, PLG and CBR are introduced to better preserve past represen-
tations and enhance generalisation across phases. Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG).In the CI-3DIS setting, during phaset(wheret>1),
although ground-truth labels for previously seen classes are unavailable, the model from the
previous phaseΦ t−1 , which preserves knowledge of past tasks, is retained. We use this
model to generate pseudo-labels for previously seen classes, thereby providing approximate
supervision during training. This allows the current modelΦt , to retain prior knowledge and
reduce forgetting, even without access to ground-truth annotations. Given a point cloud and label pair(P,Y t ), fromD t , the previous modelΦ t−1 , generates
pseudo-labels for the previously seen classes as ˆY1:t−1 =Φ t−1 (P), which we denote as ˜Yt
1For clarity, modifications introduced by each component (ER, PLG, and CBR) are highlighted in green, blue,
and red, respectively. 6THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D
for brevity. However, we observe that utilising all predictions fromΦt−1 introduces noisy or
incorrect labels, which degrade overall performance. To mitigate this, we select the top-K
most confident instance predictions, denoted as ˜Yt
K, and concatenate them with the ground-
truth labels of the current task to obtain the supervision set: ¯Yt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt
K. Following this,
the loss is computed over both the current task’s ground-truth labels and the top-Kconfi-
dent pseudo-labels from earlier phases, enabling the model to retain prior knowledge while
adapting to new classes. Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR).While ER and PLG contribute to preserving prior
knowledge, we observe that the model’s predictions are biased towards frequent classes,
resulting in the forgetting of rare categories. This issue is further amplified by the top-K
pseudo-labels selected by PLG, which predominantly represent dominant classes in the data. To address this, we propose aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) scheme that compensates
for class imbalance using object frequency statistics. At taskt, only the current datasetD t
and its label distributionp t (c)over classesc∈ Ct are available. Datasets and class distribu-
tions from earlier tasks{D i,p i(c)}t−1
i=1 are no longer accessible, which makes it challenging
to directly account for class imbalance across all previously seen tasks. Therefore, we pro-
pose to leverage the pseudo-label predictions of the frozen modelΦ t−1 as a proxy for the
class distribution across previously learned categories. During each training iteration, the previous modelΦ t−1 is applied to the current inputP
to generate pseudo-labels ˜Yt , from which we accumulate class-wise frequency statistics for
previously learned classes. LetC1:t = St
i=1 Ci represent the union of all classes seen up to task
t. At the end of each epoch, we compute the overall class frequencyf∈R |C1:t | by combining
the pseudo-label distribution ˜pt (c)derived from ˜Yt with the ground-truth label distribution
pt (c)from the current task. The resulting frequency vectorf= [f(c)] c∈C1:t is then used to
compute class-wise weightsw= [w(c)] c∈C1:t , which guide balanced pseudo-label selection
and help the model focus on rare classes. In the next epoch, the modelΦ t−1 produces soft pseudo-label predictions ˜Yt (as de-
scribed in PLG) , where each component ˜Yt [c]denotes the confidence score for classc∈
C1:t−1. To promote balanced pseudo-label selection, class-wise re-weighting is applied using
w(c) = 1
f(c)+ε , whereεis a small constant for numerical stability. The adjusted predictions
are computed by applying the class-wise weights as: ˜Yt,w [c] =w(c)· ˜Yt [c],∀c∈ C 1:t−1. Top-Kselection is then applied to both the original and the re-weighted scores, yielding
two pseudo-label sets: ˜Yt
K and ˜Yt,w
K , respectively. The final augmented target set, Yt , is
constructed by concatenating the ground-truth labelsY t with both sets of pseudo-labels:
Yt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt

Although the above re-weighting mitigates bias from prior tasks, it does not address class
imbalance within the current taskt. To resolve this, the class-balanced weightsw c are ex-
tended to incorporate statistics from both previously seen and current classes, i.e., overC 1:t
rather than onlyC 1:t−1. The updated weights, denoted asw ′
c, are used to re-weights both
pseudo-label selection and classification loss, ensuring balanced supervision across all seen
categories, including rare ones. This unified strategy reduces bias and enhances performance
across phases. The pseudo-code for constructing the supervision set in Eq. (2), which incor-
porates both PLG and CBR components, is provided in Appendix A. Final Objective.The final training objective ofCLIMB-3D, incorporating ER, PLG, and THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D7

While CI-3DIS methods offer a wide range of practical applications, they frequently rely
on the assumption of uniform sample distribution, which rarely holds in real-world settings. In practice, the number of object categories, denoted byC, is often large and characterised
by substantial variability in category frequency, shape, structure, and size. To address these
challenges, we propose three incremental learning scenarios, each designed to capture a
different facet of real-world complexity. The design of these scenarios is detailed below; for
further information and illustrations, refer to Appendix E of the supplementary material. Split-A: Frequency Scenarios.This scenario acknowledges that datasets are often la-
belled based on the frequency of categories. To accommodate this, we propose a split where
the model learns from the most frequent categories and subsequently incorporates the less
frequent ones in later stages. By prioritising the training of frequently occurring categories,
the model can establish a strong foundation before expanding to handle rare categories. Split-B: Semantic Scenarios.Beyond frequency, semantic similarity is crucial in real-
world deployments. While objects often share visual or functional traits, models may en-
counter semantically different categories in new environments. To simulate this challenge,
we introduce theSplit-Bscenario. Here, categories are grouped based on their semantic
relationships, and the model is incrementally trained on one semantic group at a time. This
setup encourages the model to generalise across semantically similar categories and adapt
more effectively when exposed to new ones. Unlike theSplit-Ascenario, which organises
learning based on category frequency, theSplit-Bscenario may contain both frequent and
infrequent categories within a single task, focusing on semantic continuity and transfer. Split-C: Random Scenarios.In some cases, data labelling is driven by the availability of
objects rather than predefined criteria. To capture this, we introduce theSplit-Cscenario,
which represents a fully random setting where any class can appear in any task, resulting in
varying levels of class imbalance. By exposing the model to such diverse and unpredictable
distributions, we aim to improve its robustness in real-world situations where labelled data
availability is inconsistent. These incremental scenarios are designed to provide a more realistic representation of
object distributions, frequencies, and dynamics encountered in the real world. 4 Experiments

assessing real-world scenarios. In addition, we compare our approach against existing in-
cremental learning methods using ScanNetV2 [16] in the 3DSS setting. For this evaluation,
we follow the standard training and validation splits defined in prior works [74] to ensure
consistency with existing methods. Evaluation Metrics.We evaluate our method usingMean Average Precision(mAP), a
standard metric for 3DIS which provides a comprehensive measure of segmentation quality
by accounting for both precision and recall. For comparison with existing 3DSS methods,
we report themean Intersection over Union(mIoU), which quantifies the overlap between
predicted and ground truth segments. To assess the model’s ability to mitigate catastrophic
forgetting in incremental settings, we use theForgetting Percentage Points(FPP) metric, as
defined in [47]. FPP captures performance degradation by measuring the accuracy drop on
the initially seen categories between the first and final training phases. Detailed descriptions of the incremental scenarios (Split-A,Split-B,Split-C) and im-
plementation are provided in Appendix B. 4.2 Results and Discussion

To evaluate our proposed approach, we construct a baseline using ER [5] for the 3DIS
setting, as no existing incremental baselines are available for this task. In contrast, for the
3DSS setting, where incremental baselines do exist, we compare our method against three
prior approaches [43, 60, 74]. Results on CI-3DIS.Tab. 1 compares CLIMB-3D against the ER baseline across the three
CI-3DIS scenarios, evaluated after all phases using mAP 25, mAP50, overall mAP, and FPP. In theSplit-Ascenario, characterised by significant distribution shifts, our method achieves
gains of +19.23%, +16.76%, and +12.28% in mAP 25, mAP 50, and overall mAP, respec-
tively, while drastically reducing forgetting with FPP scores of 3.44% (mAP 25) and 2.63%
(mAP50), both over 45 points lower than the baseline. Under theSplit-Bscenario, with
semantically related new categories, improvements of +18.26%, +16.49%, and +12.76%
are observed alongside a reduction in forgetting to 8.00% and 5.51% from baseline levels
above 42%. For theSplit-Cscenario, featuring increasing geometric complexity, CLIMB-
3D maintains solid gains of +5.94%, +5.70%, and +4.08% across mAP metrics, with forget-
ting reduced by over 22 points. Overall, these results demonstrate robust forward transfer,
minimal forgetting, and stable learning, highlighting the method’s effectiveness for scalable
continual 3D semantic understanding. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D9

Results on CI-3DSS.Although our primary focus is on CI-3DIS, we also evaluate our
method under the CI-3DSS setting to enable comparisons with existing approaches. To do
so, we adapt our predictions to assign each point the label corresponding to the highest-
confidence mask and exclude background classes (e.g., floor and wall), as these are not part
of the semantic segmentation targets. Tab. 2 presents a comparison between our method and
existing baselines on the ScanNet V2 dataset [16], evaluated using mIoU across two training
phases and overall. Although originally designed for instance segmentation, our method
generalises effectively to semantic segmentation, achieving substantial gains of +35.23%
mIoU in Phase 1 and +19.1% in Phase 2. Overall, it achieves 59.38% mIoU, significantly
higher than the∼30% mIoU of prior methods, highlighting its robustness and transferability. Refer to Appendix C, D, and F of the supplementary material for detailed analyses of per-
phase performance, rare-class evaluation, and qualitative result comparisons, respectively. 4.3 Ablation

We conduct an ablation study to evaluate the contribution of each component in our
framework. As an upper bound, we report the performance of anOraclemodel, which is
trained jointly on the full dataset. For the incremental setting, we follow the previously
defined splits and first train the model naively across phases. We then incrementally add
each module to isolate its impact. Tab. 3 presents results for theSplit-Ascenario using both
mAP50 and FPP metrics. Naïve Training.When trained naïvely without any dedicated modules, the model suffers
from severe catastrophic forgetting, as evident in row 2. The model entirely forgets pre-
viously learned classes upon entering new phases, with performance dropping to zero for
earlier splits and FPP rising to 56.82. 10THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D
Effect of ER.Adding exemplar replay (row 3) partially alleviates forgetting by maintaining
a buffer of past examples. This yields notable gains fors1in Phase 2 (+18.51%) and Phase 3
(+10.38%), and also improvess2in Phase 3 (+9.43%). However, the overall forgetting
remains substantial (FPP: 46.44), showing ER alone is insufficient. Effect of PLG.The addition of the pseudo-label generator (PLG), which generates labels for
previous classes by retaining a copy of the model from an earlier phase, facilitates knowledge
retention and forward transfer. As shown in row 4, PLG significantly reduces forgetting and
enhances performance on current tasks. Fors1, it improves mAP 50 by 31.49% in Phase 2
and 39.40% in Phase 3 over exemplar replay. Overall, PLG yields a 15.00% increase in
performance and reduces forgetting by 39.40%. Effect of CBR.Finally, class-balanced re-weighting (CBR) mitigates class imbalance dur-
ing both pseudo-labelling and current task learning by adjusting each class’s contribution
based on its frequency. As shown in row 5, CBR enhancess1retention over PLG in Phases 2

the lowest FPP of 2.63, reflecting strong forgetting mitigation. Overall, CBR offers the best
trade-off between retaining past knowledge and acquiring new tasks, outperforming PLG
and ER by 4.41% and 43.81%, respectively. 4.4 Limitations & Future Work
While CLIMB-3D achieves strong performance across CI-3DIS and CI-3DSS settings, sev-
eral limitations remain and warrant discussion. The experiments are currently limited to
indoor datasets (ScanNet200 and ScanNetV2), therefore evaluating performance on outdoor
scenes would help assess generalisability across diverse environments. The current setup
also considers only three incremental phases, whereas real-world applications often involve
longer sequences; incorporating such extended setups would better reflect practical chal-
lenges. Moreover, the model operates in a uni-modal setting. Integrating multi-modal cues,
such as vision-language models, could further enhance performance, as suggested by recent
2D and 3D studies [25, 65, 66]. 5 Conclusion
This work addresses the challenge of catastrophic forgetting in class-incremental 3D in-
stance segmentation by introducing a modular framework that integrates exemplar replay
(ER), a pseudo-label generator (PLG), and class-balanced re-weighting (CBR). The pro-
posed method incrementally adapts to new classes while preserving prior knowledge, all
without requiring access to the full dataset. Extensive experiments on a three-phase bench-
mark validate the individual and combined effectiveness of each component: ER enables
efficient memory-based retention; PLG facilitates knowledge preservation through pseudo-
supervision; and CBR mitigates class imbalance to enhance learning stability. Together,
these components significantly reduce forgetting and improve segmentation performance
across all phases. By achieving a strong balance between stability and plasticity, our ap-
proach advances continual 3D scene understanding and sets a new baseline for future re-
search in this area. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D11

1 Introduction
Table Chair Couch Pillow Coffee Table Sofa Chair Recycling BinCabinet Unknown
Task-1 Task-2 Task-3
Figure 1:Overview of the CI-3DIS setting.New object categories are introduced incre-
mentally with each task. After every phase, the model must recognise both newly added
and previously learned classes. For instance, in Task 2, categories such asPillow,Coffee
Table, andSofa Chairare introduced, while the model is expected to retain recognition
of earlier classes likeTable,Chair, andCouch. 3D instance segmentation (3DIS) is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves
identifying precise object boundaries and class labels in 3D space, with broad applications in
graphics, robotics, and augmented reality [4, 39]. Traditional 3DIS methods, including top-
down [28, 70, 78], bottom-up [26, 73], and transformer-based approaches [59], perform well
under the assumption that all classes are available and balanced during training. However,
this assumption does not hold in real-world environments, where new object classes emerge
over time and exhibit natural imbalance. This gap motivates the need for Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) [17, 54], which sup-
ports learning new categories while retaining knowledge of previous ones [51]. While CIL
has seen success in 2D image tasks [1, 43, 54, 60], extensions to 3D point clouds remain
limited, often focusing on object-level classification [13, 18, 48]. Recent works on scene-
level class-incremental 3DIS (CI-3DIS) [4] and class-incremental semantic segmentation
(CI-3DSS) [74] show promise, but depend heavily on large exemplar [56] and overlook class
imbalance, limiting their practicality. To address this, we proposeCLIMB-3D, a unified framework forCLass-incremental
IMBalance-aware3DIS that jointly tackles catastrophic forgetting and class imbalance. The
framework begins with Exemplar Replay (ER), storing a small number of samples from
past classes for later replay. However, this alone does not yield promising results under the
strict memory constraints required in CI-3DIS. To address this, we introduce a Pseudo-Label
Generator (PLG), which uses a frozen model from previous task to generate supervision for
earlier classes. However, we observed that PLG tends to favour frequent classes while ig-
noring under-represented ones. To mitigate this, we propose a Class-Balanced Re-weighting
(CBR), which estimates class frequencies from the pseudo-labels to enhance the learning of
rare classes without accessing past data. Together, these components form a practical and
effective solution for real-world 3DIS. To evaluate CLIMB-3D, we designed three benchmark scenarios for CI-3DIS based on
the ScanNet200 dataset [57]. These scenarios simulate incremental learning setup under nat-
ural class imbalance, where new classes emerge based on (A) object frequency, (B) semantic
similarity, or (C) random grouping. Additionally, for comparison with existing methods,
we evaluate our approach on CI-3DSS using the ScanNetV2 dataset [16]. Experimental re-
sults show that our method significantly reduces forgetting and improves performance across
both frequent and rare categories, outperforming previous methods in both settings. Fig. 1
illustrates the CI-3DIS setup. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D3
In summary, our contributions are: (i) a novel problem setting of imbalanced class-
incremental 3DIS with an effective method to balance learning and mitigate forgetting; (ii)
three benchmarks modelling continual object emergence with natural imbalance; and (iii)
strong experimental results, achieving up to 16.76% mAP improvement over baselines. 2 Related Work
3D Instance Segmentation.Various methods have been proposed for 3DIS. Grouping-
based approaches adopt a bottom-up pipeline that learns latent embeddings for point cluster-
ing [9, 21, 22, 29, 37, 44, 70, 78]. In contrast, proposal-based methods follow a top-down
strategy by detecting 3D boxes and segmenting objects within them [19, 26, 46, 73, 76]. Recently, transformer-based models [68] have also been applied to 3DIS and 3DSS [59, 64],
inspired by advances in 2D vision [10, 11]. However, these approaches require full anno-
tations for all classes and are not designed for progressive learning, where only new class
annotations are available and previous data is inaccessible. Another line of work aims to re-
duce annotation costs by proposing weakly supervised 3DIS methods based on sparse cues
[12, 27, 72]. While effective with limited annotations, these methods assume a fixed set of
classes and are susceptible to catastrophic forgetting in incremental settings. Incremental Learning.Continual learning involves training models sequentially to miti-
gate catastrophic forgetting. One common strategy is model regularisation, which constrains
parameter updates using techniques such as elastic weight consolidation or knowledge dis-
tillation [1, 24, 35, 43, 60]. Another approach is exemplar replay, where past data is stored
or generated to rehearse older tasks while learning new ones [5, 7, 30, 54]. A third direc-
tion involves dynamically expanding the model architecture or using modular sub-networks
to accommodate new tasks without interfering with old ones [31, 42, 53, 58, 71, 79]. Re-
cent efforts in class-incremental 3D segmentation [63, 74] have shown early promise but
often rely on basic architectures and focus primarily on semantic segmentation. Other works
[4, 36] explore continual learning in 3D settings, though they often depend on large memory
buffers. In contrast, our work introduces a tailored framework for 3D instance segmentation
that effectively transfers knowledge across tasks, even under class imbalance. Long-tailed Recognition.Imbalanced class distributions lead to poor recognition of rare
(long-tail) classes. To address this, re-sampling methods balance the data via input [8, 20, 50,
52, 61] or feature space [3, 14, 40], avoiding naïve under-/over-sampling. Loss re-weighting
offers another direction, using class-based [6, 15, 23, 32, 33, 69] or per-example [45, 55, 62]
adjustments to ensure fair contribution. Parameter regularisation improves generalisation
through weight constraints [2], albeit requiring careful tuning. Other approaches leverage
transfer learning [77, 81], self-supervision [41, 75], or contrastive learning [34, 41, 82] to
improve rare-class representations. Long-tailed recognition is well-studied in 2D with large-
scale datasets [15, 49, 67]; in 3D, ScanNet200 [16, 57] enables similar efforts. Prior 3D
work focused on re-weighting, re-sampling, and transfer learning [57], while regularisation
remains underexplored. CeCo [80] balances class centres via auxiliary loss but overlooks
sampling and augmentation. Lahoud et al. [38] propose adaptive classifier regularisation
for 3D segmentation, outperforming prior approaches without threshold tuning. However,
neither method considers incremental learning. In contrast, we jointly address long-tail and
continual 3D semantic segmentation. 4THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D

across sequential phases. During taskt, point cloudsPand their corresponding labelsY t are
sampled from a combination of the current training datasetD t and Exemplar Replay (ER),
which maintains a small memory of past examples. These are then passed to the current
modelΦ t to produce predicted labelsY t . The Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG) selects the
top-Kpredictions from the previous modelΦ t−1 . These pseudo-labels are then weighted
based on class frequencyf(c)using Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR), and the top-Kre-
weighted labels are selected to form the balanced pseudo-label set ¯Yt . This pseudo-label set
is then concatenated with the ground-truth labels to form a final augmented supervision set
Yt for taskt, which is used to optimise the modelΦ t using Eq. (3). 3 Methodology
3.1 Problem Formulation
3DIS.The objective of this task is to detect and segment each object instance within a point
cloud. Formally, the training dataset is denoted asD={(P i,Yi)}N
i=1, whereNis the number
of training samples. Each inputP i ∈R M×6 is a coloured point cloud consisting ofMpoints,
where each point is represented by its 3D coordinates and RGB values. The corresponding
annotationY i ={(m i,j ,ci,j )}Ji
j=1 containsJ i object instances, wheremi,j ∈ {0,1}M is a binary
mask indicating which points belong to thej-th instance, andc i,j ∈ C={1,...,C}is the
semantic class label of that instance. GivenP i, the modelΦpredicts instance-level outputs
ˆYi ={(ˆmi,j ,ˆci,j )}
ˆJi
j=1, where ˆmi,j and ˆci,j denote the predicted mask and category label for
thej-th instance, respectively. The number of predicted instances ˆJi varies depending on the
model’s inference. The model is optimised using the following objective:
L3DIS(D;Φ) = 1

(P,Y)∈D

|Y| ∑
(mj,cj)∈Y
(Lmask(mj,ˆmj)+λ·L cls(cj,ˆcj)),(1)
whereL cls andL mask are the average classification and mask losses over all instances, andλ
controls their trade-off. CI-3DIS.Unlike conventional 3DIS, CI-3DIS involves sequential learning, where object
categories are introduced incrementally overTtraining tasks. Each tasktintroduces a dis-
joint set of classesC t , withC= ST

encountered in previous tasks, despite limited supervision and the absence of past labels. 3.2 Method: CLIMB-3D
Overview.As shown in Fig. 2 and formulated in Sec. 3.1, the proposed framework for
CI-3DIS follows aphase-wisetraining strategy. In each phase, the model is exposed to a
carefully curated subset of the dataset, simulating real-world scenarios discussed in Sec. 3.3. Training naïvely on such phased data leads tocatastrophic forgetting[51], where the model
forgets prior knowledge when learning new tasks. To address this, we first incorporateEx-
emplar Replay(ER) [5], a strategy inspired by 2D incremental methods [1, 43, 54] and
recently extended to 3D settings [4], to mitigate forgetting by storing a small set of repre-
sentative samples from earlier phases. However, ER alone is insufficient to achieve robust
performance. To address this, two additional components are introduced: aPseudo-Label
Generator(PLG), which leverages a frozen model to generate supervision signals for previ-
ously seen classes, and aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) module that compensates for
class imbalance across phases. Each of these components is described in detail below 1. Exemplar Replay (ER).Inspired by Buzzega et al. [5], ER addresses the issue of catas-
trophic forgetting by allowing the model to retain a subset of data from earlier phases. During phaset, the model is trained not only on the current task dataD t , but also on a
set of exemplarsE 1:t−1, collected from previous phases. These exemplars are accumulated
incrementally:E 1:t−1 =E 1 ∪···∪E t−1 .Here,E t denotes the exemplar subset stored after
phaset, and|E t |denotes the exemplar replay size. The combined replay dataset is denoted
as:D t
ER =D t ∪E 1:t−1.Epoch training consists of two stages: first, the model is trained on
the current data,D t ; then it is trained using exemplars fromE 1:t−1. While previous CI-3DIS approaches rely on large exemplar sets to mitigate forgetting [4],
such strategies become impractical under memory constraints. Consequently, although ER
aids knowledge retention, it is insufficient on its own for robust performance with a limited
exemplar budget. Therefore, PLG and CBR are introduced to better preserve past represen-
tations and enhance generalisation across phases. Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG).In the CI-3DIS setting, during phaset(wheret>1),
although ground-truth labels for previously seen classes are unavailable, the model from the
previous phaseΦ t−1 , which preserves knowledge of past tasks, is retained. We use this
model to generate pseudo-labels for previously seen classes, thereby providing approximate
supervision during training. This allows the current modelΦt , to retain prior knowledge and
reduce forgetting, even without access to ground-truth annotations. Given a point cloud and label pair(P,Y t ), fromD t , the previous modelΦ t−1 , generates
pseudo-labels for the previously seen classes as ˆY1:t−1 =Φ t−1 (P), which we denote as ˜Yt
1For clarity, modifications introduced by each component (ER, PLG, and CBR) are highlighted in green, blue,
and red, respectively. 6THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D
for brevity. However, we observe that utilising all predictions fromΦt−1 introduces noisy or
incorrect labels, which degrade overall performance. To mitigate this, we select the top-K
most confident instance predictions, denoted as ˜Yt
K, and concatenate them with the ground-
truth labels of the current task to obtain the supervision set: ¯Yt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt
K. Following this,
the loss is computed over both the current task’s ground-truth labels and the top-Kconfi-
dent pseudo-labels from earlier phases, enabling the model to retain prior knowledge while
adapting to new classes. Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR).While ER and PLG contribute to preserving prior
knowledge, we observe that the model’s predictions are biased towards frequent classes,
resulting in the forgetting of rare categories. This issue is further amplified by the top-K
pseudo-labels selected by PLG, which predominantly represent dominant classes in the data. To address this, we propose aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) scheme that compensates
for class imbalance using object frequency statistics. At taskt, only the current datasetD t
and its label distributionp t (c)over classesc∈ Ct are available. Datasets and class distribu-
tions from earlier tasks{D i,p i(c)}t−1
i=1 are no longer accessible, which makes it challenging
to directly account for class imbalance across all previously seen tasks. Therefore, we pro-
pose to leverage the pseudo-label predictions of the frozen modelΦ t−1 as a proxy for the
class distribution across previously learned categories. During each training iteration, the previous modelΦ t−1 is applied to the current inputP
to generate pseudo-labels ˜Yt , from which we accumulate class-wise frequency statistics for
previously learned classes. LetC1:t = St
i=1 Ci represent the union of all classes seen up to task
t. At the end of each epoch, we compute the overall class frequencyf∈R |C1:t | by combining
the pseudo-label distribution ˜pt (c)derived from ˜Yt with the ground-truth label distribution
pt (c)from the current task. The resulting frequency vectorf= [f(c)] c∈C1:t is then used to
compute class-wise weightsw= [w(c)] c∈C1:t , which guide balanced pseudo-label selection
and help the model focus on rare classes. In the next epoch, the modelΦ t−1 produces soft pseudo-label predictions ˜Yt (as de-
scribed in PLG) , where each component ˜Yt [c]denotes the confidence score for classc∈
C1:t−1. To promote balanced pseudo-label selection, class-wise re-weighting is applied using
w(c) = 1
f(c)+ε , whereεis a small constant for numerical stability. The adjusted predictions
are computed by applying the class-wise weights as: ˜Yt,w [c] =w(c)· ˜Yt [c],∀c∈ C 1:t−1. Top-Kselection is then applied to both the original and the re-weighted scores, yielding
two pseudo-label sets: ˜Yt
K and ˜Yt,w
K , respectively. The final augmented target set, Yt , is
constructed by concatenating the ground-truth labelsY t with both sets of pseudo-labels:
Yt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt
K ∥ ˜Yt,w
K .(2)
Although the above re-weighting mitigates bias from prior tasks, it does not address class
imbalance within the current taskt. To resolve this, the class-balanced weightsw c are ex-
tended to incorporate statistics from both previously seen and current classes, i.e., overC 1:t
rather than onlyC 1:t−1. The updated weights, denoted asw ′
c, are used to re-weights both
pseudo-label selection and classification loss, ensuring balanced supervision across all seen
categories, including rare ones. This unified strategy reduces bias and enhances performance
across phases. The pseudo-code for constructing the supervision set in Eq. (2), which incor-
porates both PLG and CBR components, is provided in Appendix A. Final Objective.The final training objective ofCLIMB-3D, incorporating ER, PLG, and THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D7
CBR, is formulated in Eq. (1) as:

While CI-3DIS methods offer a wide range of practical applications, they frequently rely
on the assumption of uniform sample distribution, which rarely holds in real-world settings. In practice, the number of object categories, denoted byC, is often large and characterised
by substantial variability in category frequency, shape, structure, and size. To address these
challenges, we propose three incremental learning scenarios, each designed to capture a
different facet of real-world complexity. The design of these scenarios is detailed below; for
further information and illustrations, refer to Appendix E of the supplementary material. Split-A: Frequency Scenarios.This scenario acknowledges that datasets are often la-
belled based on the frequency of categories. To accommodate this, we propose a split where
the model learns from the most frequent categories and subsequently incorporates the less
frequent ones in later stages. By prioritising the training of frequently occurring categories,
the model can establish a strong foundation before expanding to handle rare categories. Split-B: Semantic Scenarios.Beyond frequency, semantic similarity is crucial in real-
world deployments. While objects often share visual or functional traits, models may en-
counter semantically different categories in new environments. To simulate this challenge,
we introduce theSplit-Bscenario. Here, categories are grouped based on their semantic
relationships, and the model is incrementally trained on one semantic group at a time. This
setup encourages the model to generalise across semantically similar categories and adapt
more effectively when exposed to new ones. Unlike theSplit-Ascenario, which organises
learning based on category frequency, theSplit-Bscenario may contain both frequent and
infrequent categories within a single task, focusing on semantic continuity and transfer. Split-C: Random Scenarios.In some cases, data labelling is driven by the availability of
objects rather than predefined criteria. To capture this, we introduce theSplit-Cscenario,
which represents a fully random setting where any class can appear in any task, resulting in
varying levels of class imbalance. By exposing the model to such diverse and unpredictable
distributions, we aim to improve its robustness in real-world situations where labelled data
availability is inconsistent. These incremental scenarios are designed to provide a more realistic representation of
object distributions, frequencies, and dynamics encountered in the real world. 4 Experiments

assessing real-world scenarios. In addition, we compare our approach against existing in-
cremental learning methods using ScanNetV2 [16] in the 3DSS setting. For this evaluation,
we follow the standard training and validation splits defined in prior works [74] to ensure
consistency with existing methods. Evaluation Metrics.We evaluate our method usingMean Average Precision(mAP), a
standard metric for 3DIS which provides a comprehensive measure of segmentation quality
by accounting for both precision and recall. For comparison with existing 3DSS methods,
we report themean Intersection over Union(mIoU), which quantifies the overlap between
predicted and ground truth segments. To assess the model’s ability to mitigate catastrophic
forgetting in incremental settings, we use theForgetting Percentage Points(FPP) metric, as
defined in [47]. FPP captures performance degradation by measuring the accuracy drop on
the initially seen categories between the first and final training phases. Detailed descriptions of the incremental scenarios (Split-A,Split-B,Split-C) and im-
plementation are provided in Appendix B. 4.2 Results and Discussion

To evaluate our proposed approach, we construct a baseline using ER [5] for the 3DIS
setting, as no existing incremental baselines are available for this task. In contrast, for the
3DSS setting, where incremental baselines do exist, we compare our method against three
prior approaches [43, 60, 74]. Results on CI-3DIS.Tab. 1 compares CLIMB-3D against the ER baseline across the three
CI-3DIS scenarios, evaluated after all phases using mAP 25, mAP50, overall mAP, and FPP. In theSplit-Ascenario, characterised by significant distribution shifts, our method achieves
gains of +19.23%, +16.76%, and +12.28% in mAP 25, mAP 50, and overall mAP, respec-
tively, while drastically reducing forgetting with FPP scores of 3.44% (mAP 25) and 2.63%
(mAP50), both over 45 points lower than the baseline. Under theSplit-Bscenario, with
semantically related new categories, improvements of +18.26%, +16.49%, and +12.76%
are observed alongside a reduction in forgetting to 8.00% and 5.51% from baseline levels
above 42%. For theSplit-Cscenario, featuring increasing geometric complexity, CLIMB-
3D maintains solid gains of +5.94%, +5.70%, and +4.08% across mAP metrics, with forget-
ting reduced by over 22 points. Overall, these results demonstrate robust forward transfer,
minimal forgetting, and stable learning, highlighting the method’s effectiveness for scalable
continual 3D semantic understanding. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D9

Results on CI-3DSS.Although our primary focus is on CI-3DIS, we also evaluate our
method under the CI-3DSS setting to enable comparisons with existing approaches. To do
so, we adapt our predictions to assign each point the label corresponding to the highest-
confidence mask and exclude background classes (e.g., floor and wall), as these are not part
of the semantic segmentation targets. Tab. 2 presents a comparison between our method and
existing baselines on the ScanNet V2 dataset [16], evaluated using mIoU across two training
phases and overall. Although originally designed for instance segmentation, our method
generalises effectively to semantic segmentation, achieving substantial gains of +35.23%
mIoU in Phase 1 and +19.1% in Phase 2. Overall, it achieves 59.38% mIoU, significantly
higher than the∼30% mIoU of prior methods, highlighting its robustness and transferability. Refer to Appendix C, D, and F of the supplementary material for detailed analyses of per-
phase performance, rare-class evaluation, and qualitative result comparisons, respectively. 4.3 Ablation

We conduct an ablation study to evaluate the contribution of each component in our
framework. As an upper bound, we report the performance of anOraclemodel, which is
trained jointly on the full dataset. For the incremental setting, we follow the previously
defined splits and first train the model naively across phases. We then incrementally add
each module to isolate its impact. Tab. 3 presents results for theSplit-Ascenario using both
mAP50 and FPP metrics. Naïve Training.When trained naïvely without any dedicated modules, the model suffers
from severe catastrophic forgetting, as evident in row 2. The model entirely forgets pre-
viously learned classes upon entering new phases, with performance dropping to zero for
earlier splits and FPP rising to 56.82. 10THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D
Effect of ER.Adding exemplar replay (row 3) partially alleviates forgetting by maintaining
a buffer of past examples. This yields notable gains fors1in Phase 2 (+18.51%) and Phase 3
(+10.38%), and also improvess2in Phase 3 (+9.43%). However, the overall forgetting
remains substantial (FPP: 46.44), showing ER alone is insufficient. Effect of PLG.The addition of the pseudo-label generator (PLG), which generates labels for
previous classes by retaining a copy of the model from an earlier phase, facilitates knowledge
retention and forward transfer. As shown in row 4, PLG significantly reduces forgetting and
enhances performance on current tasks. Fors1, it improves mAP 50 by 31.49% in Phase 2
and 39.40% in Phase 3 over exemplar replay. Overall, PLG yields a 15.00% increase in
performance and reduces forgetting by 39.40%. Effect of CBR.Finally, class-balanced re-weighting (CBR) mitigates class imbalance dur-
ing both pseudo-labelling and current task learning by adjusting each class’s contribution
based on its frequency. As shown in row 5, CBR enhancess1retention over PLG in Phases 2
and 3 (+4.67% and +4.41%), and further improves performance ons2ands3. It also achieves
the lowest FPP of 2.63, reflecting strong forgetting mitigation. Overall, CBR offers the best
trade-off between retaining past knowledge and acquiring new tasks, outperforming PLG
and ER by 4.41% and 43.81%, respectively. 4.4 Limitations & Future Work
While CLIMB-3D achieves strong performance across CI-3DIS and CI-3DSS settings, sev-
eral limitations remain and warrant discussion. The experiments are currently limited to
indoor datasets (ScanNet200 and ScanNetV2), therefore evaluating performance on outdoor
scenes would help assess generalisability across diverse environments. The current setup
also considers only three incremental phases, whereas real-world applications often involve
longer sequences; incorporating such extended setups would better reflect practical chal-
lenges. Moreover, the model operates in a uni-modal setting. Integrating multi-modal cues,
such as vision-language models, could further enhance performance, as suggested by recent
2D and 3D studies [25, 65, 66]. 5 Conclusion
This work addresses the challenge of catastrophic forgetting in class-incremental 3D in-
stance segmentation by introducing a modular framework that integrates exemplar replay
(ER), a pseudo-label generator (PLG), and class-balanced re-weighting (CBR). The pro-
posed method incrementally adapts to new classes while preserving prior knowledge, all
without requiring access to the full dataset. Extensive experiments on a three-phase bench-
mark validate the individual and combined effectiveness of each component: ER enables
efficient memory-based retention; PLG facilitates knowledge preservation through pseudo-
supervision; and CBR mitigates class imbalance to enhance learning stability. Together,
these components significantly reduce forgetting and improve segmentation performance
across all phases. By achieving a strong balance between stability and plasticity, our ap-
proach advances continual 3D scene understanding and sets a new baseline for future re-
search in this area. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D11

Abstract
While 3D instance segmentation (3DIS) has advanced significantly, most existing
methods assume that all object classes are known in advance and uniformly distributed. However, this assumption is unrealistic in dynamic, real-world environments where new
classes emerge gradually and exhibit natural imbalance. Although some approaches ad-
dress the emergence of new classes, they often overlook class imbalance, which leads
to suboptimal performance, particularly on rare categories. To tackle this, we propose
CLIMB-3D, a unified framework forCLass-incrementalImbalance-aware3DIS. Build-
ing upon established exemplar replay (ER) strategies, we show that ER alone is insuf-
ficient to achieve robust performance under memory constraints. To mitigate this, we
introduce a novel pseudo-label generator (PLG) that extends supervision to previously
learned categories by leveraging predictions from a frozen model trained on prior tasks. Despite its promise, PLG tends to be biased towards frequent classes. Therefore, we
propose a class-balanced re-weighting (CBR) scheme that estimates object frequencies
from pseudo-labels and dynamically adjusts training bias, without requiring access to
past data. We design and evaluate three incremental scenarios for 3DIS on the challeng-
ing ScanNet200 dataset and additionally validate our method for semantic segmentation
on ScanNetV2. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing prior work by
up to 16.76% mAP for instance segmentation and approximately 30% mIoU for semantic
segmentation, demonstrating strong generalisation across both frequent and rare classes. Code is available at:https://github.com/vgthengane/CLIMB3D. © 2025.

1 to Tab. 4 to highlight the impact of our proposed method
on individual splits across various scenarios. The results clearly demonstrate that our model
consistently retains knowledge of previous tasks better than the baseline. ForSplit-A, our
model shows improvement throughout the phase. In Phase 3 of (s2), although both the base-
line and our method exhibit a performance drop, our method reduces forgetting significantly
compared to the baseline. TheSplit-Bscenario, while more complex thanSplit-A, achieves
comparable results due to semantic similarity among classes within the same task. In Phase
2, our model achieves overall all 43.13% mAP50 compared to 24.53% on baseline, a similar
trend is observed in Phase 3, where our method not only consistently improves learning but
also enhances retention of previous information. After all three tasks, our method achieves
an overall performance of 31.56% AP50, compared to 15.07% for the baseline. In theSplit-
Cscenario, the first-stage model struggles due to the increased complexity introduced by
random grouping. In Phase 2, while the baseline focuses on learning the current task, it suf-
fers from severe forgetting of prior knowledge. Conversely, our method balances new task
learning with the retention of earlier information. By Phase 3, the model effectively con- 2THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D

method improves mAP by 5.6%. In this supplementary material, we first demonstrate the performance gains on rare classes
achieved by incorporating the IC module in Appendix C. Next, we provide detailed split in-
formation for all scenarios, based on class names, in Appendix D. Finally, we present a qual-
itative comparison between the baseline method and our proposed approach in Appendix
E. Appendix C Evaluation on Rare Categories
The proposed imbalance correction (IC) module, as detailed in Section 4.2, is designed to
address the performance gap for rare classes. To assess its impact, we compare its perfor-
mance with the framework which has exemplar replay (ER) and knowledge distillation (KD). Specifically, we focus on its ability to improve performance for rare classes, which the model
encounters infrequently compared to more common classes. The results, shown in Tab.

5 and Tab. 6, correspond to evaluations onSplit-AforPhase
2andPhase 3, respectively. InPhase 2, we evaluate classes seen 1–20 times per epoch,
whilePhase 3targets even less frequent classes, with observations limited to 1–10 times per
epoch. As illustrated in Tab. 5, the IC module substantially improves performance on rare
classes in terms of mAP 50 in Phase 2 ofSplit-A. For instance, classes likerecycling
binandtrash bin, seen only 3 and 7 times, respectively, shows significant improvement
when the IC module is applied. Overall, the IC module provides an average boost of 8.32%,
highlighting its effectiveness in mitigating class imbalance. Similarly, Tab. 6 presents results forPhase 3, demonstrating significant gains for infre-
quent classes. For example, even though the classes such aspiano,bucket, andlaundry
basketare observed only once, IC module improves the performance by 52.30%, 10.40%,
and 13.60%, respectively. The ER+KD module does not focus on rare classes likeshower
andtoasterwhich results in low performance, but the IC module compensates for this imbal-

Abstract
While 3D instance segmentation (3DIS) has advanced significantly, most existing
methods assume that all object classes are known in advance and uniformly distributed. However, this assumption is unrealistic in dynamic, real-world environments where new
classes emerge gradually and exhibit natural imbalance. Although some approaches ad-
dress the emergence of new classes, they often overlook class imbalance, which leads
to suboptimal performance, particularly on rare categories. To tackle this, we propose
CLIMB-3D, a unified framework forCLass-incrementalImbalance-aware3DIS. Build-
ing upon established exemplar replay (ER) strategies, we show that ER alone is insuf-
ficient to achieve robust performance under memory constraints. To mitigate this, we
introduce a novel pseudo-label generator (PLG) that extends supervision to previously
learned categories by leveraging predictions from a frozen model trained on prior tasks. Despite its promise, PLG tends to be biased towards frequent classes. Therefore, we
propose a class-balanced re-weighting (CBR) scheme that estimates object frequencies
from pseudo-labels and dynamically adjusts training bias, without requiring access to
past data. We design and evaluate three incremental scenarios for 3DIS on the challeng-
ing ScanNet200 dataset and additionally validate our method for semantic segmentation
on ScanNetV2. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing prior work by
up to 16.76% mAP for instance segmentation and approximately 30% mIoU for semantic
segmentation, demonstrating strong generalisation across both frequent and rare classes. Code is available at:https://github.com/vgthengane/CLIMB3D. © 2025.

Abstract
While 3D instance segmentation (3DIS) has advanced significantly, most existing
methods assume that all object classes are known in advance and uniformly distributed. However, this assumption is unrealistic in dynamic, real-world environments where new
classes emerge gradually and exhibit natural imbalance. Although some approaches ad-
dress the emergence of new classes, they often overlook class imbalance, which leads
to suboptimal performance, particularly on rare categories. To tackle this, we propose
CLIMB-3D, a unified framework forCLass-incrementalImbalance-aware3DIS. Build-
ing upon established exemplar replay (ER) strategies, we show that ER alone is insuf-
ficient to achieve robust performance under memory constraints. To mitigate this, we
introduce a novel pseudo-label generator (PLG) that extends supervision to previously
learned categories by leveraging predictions from a frozen model trained on prior tasks. Despite its promise, PLG tends to be biased towards frequent classes. Therefore, we
propose a class-balanced re-weighting (CBR) scheme that estimates object frequencies
from pseudo-labels and dynamically adjusts training bias, without requiring access to
past data. We design and evaluate three incremental scenarios for 3DIS on the challeng-
ing ScanNet200 dataset and additionally validate our method for semantic segmentation
on ScanNetV2. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing prior work by
up to 16.76% mAP for instance segmentation and approximately 30% mIoU for semantic
segmentation, demonstrating strong generalisation across both frequent and rare classes. Code is available at:https://github.com/vgthengane/CLIMB3D. © 2025.

5 and Tab. 6, correspond to evaluations onSplit-AforPhase
2andPhase 3, respectively. InPhase 2, we evaluate classes seen 1–20 times per epoch,
whilePhase 3targets even less frequent classes, with observations limited to 1–10 times per
epoch. As illustrated in Tab. 5, the IC module substantially improves performance on rare
classes in terms of mAP 50 in Phase 2 ofSplit-A. For instance, classes likerecycling
binandtrash bin, seen only 3 and 7 times, respectively, shows significant improvement
when the IC module is applied. Overall, the IC module provides an average boost of 8.32%,
highlighting its effectiveness in mitigating class imbalance. Similarly, Tab. 6 presents results forPhase 3, demonstrating significant gains for infre-
quent classes. For example, even though the classes such aspiano,bucket, andlaundry
basketare observed only once, IC module improves the performance by 52.30%, 10.40%,
and 13.60%, respectively. The ER+KD module does not focus on rare classes likeshower
andtoasterwhich results in low performance, but the IC module compensates for this imbal-
ance by focusing on underrepresented categories. On average, the addition of the proposed THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D3

into three tasks: Task 1, Task 2, and Task 3. Notably, the order of classes in these tasks is
random. Appendix E Qualitative Results
In this section, we present a qualitative comparison of the proposed framework with the
baseline method. Fig. 4 illustrates the results on theSplit-Aevaluation after learning all
tasks, comparing the performance of the baseline method and our proposed approach. As
shown in the figure, our method demonstrates superior instance segmentation performance
compared to the baseline. For example, in row 1, the baseline method fails to segment
thesink, while in row 3, thesofainstance is missed. Overall, our framework consistently
outperforms the baseline, with several missed instances by the baseline highlighted in red 4THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D

on individual splits across various scenarios. The results clearly demonstrate that our model
consistently retains knowledge of previous tasks better than the baseline. ForSplit-A, our
model shows improvement throughout the phase. In Phase 3 of (s2), although both the base-
line and our method exhibit a performance drop, our method reduces forgetting significantly
compared to the baseline. TheSplit-Bscenario, while more complex thanSplit-A, achieves
comparable results due to semantic similarity among classes within the same task. In Phase

an overall performance of 31.56% AP50, compared to 15.07% for the baseline. In theSplit-

consistently retains knowledge of previous tasks better than the baseline. ForSplit-A, our
model shows improvement throughout the phase. In Phase 3 of (s2), although both the base-
line and our method exhibit a performance drop, our method reduces forgetting significantly

comparable results due to semantic similarity among classes within the same task. In Phase

whilePhase 3targets even less frequent classes, with observations limited to 1–10 times per

classes in terms of mAP 50 in Phase 2 ofSplit-A. For instance, classes likerecycling

baseline method. Fig. 4 illustrates the results on theSplit-Aevaluation after learning all
tasks, comparing the performance of the baseline method and our proposed approach. As

on individual splits across various scenarios. The results clearly demonstrate that our model
consistently retains knowledge of previous tasks better than the baseline. ForSplit-A, our
model shows improvement throughout the phase. In Phase 3 of (s2), although both the base-
line and our method exhibit a performance drop, our method reduces forgetting significantly
compared to the baseline. TheSplit-Bscenario, while more complex thanSplit-A, achieves
comparable results due to semantic similarity among classes within the same task. In Phase
2, our model achieves overall all 43.13% mAP50 compared to 24.53% on baseline, a similar
trend is observed in Phase 3, where our method not only consistently improves learning but
also enhances retention of previous information. After all three tasks, our method achieves
an overall performance of 31.56% AP50, compared to 15.07% for the baseline. In theSplit-
Cscenario, the first-stage model struggles due to the increased complexity introduced by
random grouping. In Phase 2, while the baseline focuses on learning the current task, it suf-
fers from severe forgetting of prior knowledge. Conversely, our method balances new task
learning with the retention of earlier information. By Phase 3, the model effectively con- 2THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D

address the performance gap for rare classes. To assess its impact, we compare its perfor-
mance with the framework which has exemplar replay (ER) and knowledge distillation (KD). Specifically, we focus on its ability to improve performance for rare classes, which the model

1 Introduction
Table Chair Couch Pillow Coffee Table Sofa Chair Recycling BinCabinet Unknown
Task-1 Task-2 Task-3
Figure 1:Overview of the CI-3DIS setting.New object categories are introduced incre-
mentally with each task. After every phase, the model must recognise both newly added
and previously learned classes. For instance, in Task 2, categories such asPillow,Coffee
Table, andSofa Chairare introduced, while the model is expected to retain recognition
of earlier classes likeTable,Chair, andCouch. 3D instance segmentation (3DIS) is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves
identifying precise object boundaries and class labels in 3D space, with broad applications in
graphics, robotics, and augmented reality [4, 39]. Traditional 3DIS methods, including top-
down [28, 70, 78], bottom-up [26, 73], and transformer-based approaches [59], perform well
under the assumption that all classes are available and balanced during training. However,
this assumption does not hold in real-world environments, where new object classes emerge
over time and exhibit natural imbalance. This gap motivates the need for Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) [17, 54], which sup-
ports learning new categories while retaining knowledge of previous ones [51]. While CIL
has seen success in 2D image tasks [1, 43, 54, 60], extensions to 3D point clouds remain
limited, often focusing on object-level classification [13, 18, 48]. Recent works on scene-
level class-incremental 3DIS (CI-3DIS) [4] and class-incremental semantic segmentation
(CI-3DSS) [74] show promise, but depend heavily on large exemplar [56] and overlook class
imbalance, limiting their practicality. To address this, we proposeCLIMB-3D, a unified framework forCLass-incremental
IMBalance-aware3DIS that jointly tackles catastrophic forgetting and class imbalance. The
framework begins with Exemplar Replay (ER), storing a small number of samples from
past classes for later replay. However, this alone does not yield promising results under the
strict memory constraints required in CI-3DIS. To address this, we introduce a Pseudo-Label
Generator (PLG), which uses a frozen model from previous task to generate supervision for
earlier classes. However, we observed that PLG tends to favour frequent classes while ig-
noring under-represented ones. To mitigate this, we propose a Class-Balanced Re-weighting
(CBR), which estimates class frequencies from the pseudo-labels to enhance the learning of
rare classes without accessing past data. Together, these components form a practical and
effective solution for real-world 3DIS. To evaluate CLIMB-3D, we designed three benchmark scenarios for CI-3DIS based on
the ScanNet200 dataset [57]. These scenarios simulate incremental learning setup under nat-
ural class imbalance, where new classes emerge based on (A) object frequency, (B) semantic
similarity, or (C) random grouping. Additionally, for comparison with existing methods,
we evaluate our approach on CI-3DSS using the ScanNetV2 dataset [16]. Experimental re-
sults show that our method significantly reduces forgetting and improves performance across
both frequent and rare categories, outperforming previous methods in both settings. Fig. 1
illustrates the CI-3DIS setup. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D3
In summary, our contributions are: (i) a novel problem setting of imbalanced class-
incremental 3DIS with an effective method to balance learning and mitigate forgetting; (ii)
three benchmarks modelling continual object emergence with natural imbalance; and (iii)
strong experimental results, achieving up to 16.76% mAP improvement over baselines. 2 Related Work
3D Instance Segmentation.Various methods have been proposed for 3DIS. Grouping-
based approaches adopt a bottom-up pipeline that learns latent embeddings for point cluster-
ing [9, 21, 22, 29, 37, 44, 70, 78]. In contrast, proposal-based methods follow a top-down
strategy by detecting 3D boxes and segmenting objects within them [19, 26, 46, 73, 76]. Recently, transformer-based models [68] have also been applied to 3DIS and 3DSS [59, 64],
inspired by advances in 2D vision [10, 11]. However, these approaches require full anno-
tations for all classes and are not designed for progressive learning, where only new class
annotations are available and previous data is inaccessible. Another line of work aims to re-
duce annotation costs by proposing weakly supervised 3DIS methods based on sparse cues
[12, 27, 72]. While effective with limited annotations, these methods assume a fixed set of
classes and are susceptible to catastrophic forgetting in incremental settings. Incremental Learning.Continual learning involves training models sequentially to miti-
gate catastrophic forgetting. One common strategy is model regularisation, which constrains
parameter updates using techniques such as elastic weight consolidation or knowledge dis-
tillation [1, 24, 35, 43, 60]. Another approach is exemplar replay, where past data is stored
or generated to rehearse older tasks while learning new ones [5, 7, 30, 54]. A third direc-
tion involves dynamically expanding the model architecture or using modular sub-networks
to accommodate new tasks without interfering with old ones [31, 42, 53, 58, 71, 79]. Re-
cent efforts in class-incremental 3D segmentation [63, 74] have shown early promise but
often rely on basic architectures and focus primarily on semantic segmentation. Other works
[4, 36] explore continual learning in 3D settings, though they often depend on large memory
buffers. In contrast, our work introduces a tailored framework for 3D instance segmentation
that effectively transfers knowledge across tasks, even under class imbalance. Long-tailed Recognition.Imbalanced class distributions lead to poor recognition of rare
(long-tail) classes. To address this, re-sampling methods balance the data via input [8, 20, 50,
52, 61] or feature space [3, 14, 40], avoiding naïve under-/over-sampling. Loss re-weighting
offers another direction, using class-based [6, 15, 23, 32, 33, 69] or per-example [45, 55, 62]
adjustments to ensure fair contribution. Parameter regularisation improves generalisation
through weight constraints [2], albeit requiring careful tuning. Other approaches leverage
transfer learning [77, 81], self-supervision [41, 75], or contrastive learning [34, 41, 82] to
improve rare-class representations. Long-tailed recognition is well-studied in 2D with large-
scale datasets [15, 49, 67]; in 3D, ScanNet200 [16, 57] enables similar efforts. Prior 3D
work focused on re-weighting, re-sampling, and transfer learning [57], while regularisation
remains underexplored. CeCo [80] balances class centres via auxiliary loss but overlooks
sampling and augmentation. Lahoud et al. [38] propose adaptive classifier regularisation
for 3D segmentation, outperforming prior approaches without threshold tuning. However,
neither method considers incremental learning. In contrast, we jointly address long-tail and
continual 3D semantic segmentation. 4THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D

Figure 2: Overview ofCLIMB-3Dfor CI-3DIS. The model incrementally learns new classes
across sequential phases. During taskt, point cloudsPand their corresponding labelsY t are
sampled from a combination of the current training datasetD t and Exemplar Replay (ER),
which maintains a small memory of past examples. These are then passed to the current
modelΦ t to produce predicted labelsY t . The Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG) selects the
top-Kpredictions from the previous modelΦ t−1 . These pseudo-labels are then weighted
based on class frequencyf(c)using Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR), and the top-Kre-
weighted labels are selected to form the balanced pseudo-label set ¯Yt . This pseudo-label set
is then concatenated with the ground-truth labels to form a final augmented supervision set
Yt for taskt, which is used to optimise the modelΦ t using Eq. (3). 3 Methodology

3DIS.The objective of this task is to detect and segment each object instance within a point
cloud. Formally, the training dataset is denoted asD={(P i,Yi)}N
i=1, whereNis the number
of training samples. Each inputP i ∈R M×6 is a coloured point cloud consisting ofMpoints,
where each point is represented by its 3D coordinates and RGB values. The corresponding
annotationY i ={(m i,j ,ci,j )}Ji
j=1 containsJ i object instances, wheremi,j ∈ {0,1}M is a binary
mask indicating which points belong to thej-th instance, andc i,j ∈ C={1,...,C}is the
semantic class label of that instance. GivenP i, the modelΦpredicts instance-level outputs
ˆYi ={(ˆmi,j ,ˆci,j )}
ˆJi
j=1, where ˆmi,j and ˆci,j denote the predicted mask and category label for
thej-th instance, respectively. The number of predicted instances ˆJi varies depending on the
model’s inference. The model is optimised using the following objective:

whereL cls andL mask are the average classification and mask losses over all instances, andλ
controls their trade-off. CI-3DIS.Unlike conventional 3DIS, CI-3DIS involves sequential learning, where object
categories are introduced incrementally overTtraining tasks. Each tasktintroduces a dis-

Overview.As shown in Fig. 2 and formulated in Sec. 3.1, the proposed framework for
CI-3DIS follows aphase-wisetraining strategy. In each phase, the model is exposed to a
carefully curated subset of the dataset, simulating real-world scenarios discussed in Sec. 3.3. Training naïvely on such phased data leads tocatastrophic forgetting[51], where the model
forgets prior knowledge when learning new tasks. To address this, we first incorporateEx-
emplar Replay(ER) [5], a strategy inspired by 2D incremental methods [1, 43, 54] and
recently extended to 3D settings [4], to mitigate forgetting by storing a small set of repre-
sentative samples from earlier phases. However, ER alone is insufficient to achieve robust
performance. To address this, two additional components are introduced: aPseudo-Label
Generator(PLG), which leverages a frozen model to generate supervision signals for previ-
ously seen classes, and aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) module that compensates for
class imbalance across phases. Each of these components is described in detail below 1. Exemplar Replay (ER).Inspired by Buzzega et al. [5], ER addresses the issue of catas-
trophic forgetting by allowing the model to retain a subset of data from earlier phases. During phaset, the model is trained not only on the current task dataD t , but also on a
set of exemplarsE 1:t−1, collected from previous phases. These exemplars are accumulated
incrementally:E 1:t−1 =E 1 ∪···∪E t−1 .Here,E t denotes the exemplar subset stored after
phaset, and|E t |denotes the exemplar replay size. The combined replay dataset is denoted
as:D t
ER =D t ∪E 1:t−1.Epoch training consists of two stages: first, the model is trained on
the current data,D t ; then it is trained using exemplars fromE 1:t−1. While previous CI-3DIS approaches rely on large exemplar sets to mitigate forgetting [4],
such strategies become impractical under memory constraints. Consequently, although ER
aids knowledge retention, it is insufficient on its own for robust performance with a limited
exemplar budget. Therefore, PLG and CBR are introduced to better preserve past represen-
tations and enhance generalisation across phases. Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG).In the CI-3DIS setting, during phaset(wheret>1),
although ground-truth labels for previously seen classes are unavailable, the model from the
previous phaseΦ t−1 , which preserves knowledge of past tasks, is retained. We use this
model to generate pseudo-labels for previously seen classes, thereby providing approximate
supervision during training. This allows the current modelΦt , to retain prior knowledge and
reduce forgetting, even without access to ground-truth annotations. Given a point cloud and label pair(P,Y t ), fromD t , the previous modelΦ t−1 , generates
pseudo-labels for the previously seen classes as ˆY1:t−1 =Φ t−1 (P), which we denote as ˜Yt
1For clarity, modifications introduced by each component (ER, PLG, and CBR) are highlighted in green, blue,
and red, respectively. 6THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D
for brevity. However, we observe that utilising all predictions fromΦt−1 introduces noisy or
incorrect labels, which degrade overall performance. To mitigate this, we select the top-K
most confident instance predictions, denoted as ˜Yt
K, and concatenate them with the ground-
truth labels of the current task to obtain the supervision set: ¯Yt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt
K. Following this,
the loss is computed over both the current task’s ground-truth labels and the top-Kconfi-
dent pseudo-labels from earlier phases, enabling the model to retain prior knowledge while
adapting to new classes. Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR).While ER and PLG contribute to preserving prior
knowledge, we observe that the model’s predictions are biased towards frequent classes,
resulting in the forgetting of rare categories. This issue is further amplified by the top-K
pseudo-labels selected by PLG, which predominantly represent dominant classes in the data. To address this, we propose aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) scheme that compensates
for class imbalance using object frequency statistics. At taskt, only the current datasetD t
and its label distributionp t (c)over classesc∈ Ct are available. Datasets and class distribu-
tions from earlier tasks{D i,p i(c)}t−1
i=1 are no longer accessible, which makes it challenging
to directly account for class imbalance across all previously seen tasks. Therefore, we pro-
pose to leverage the pseudo-label predictions of the frozen modelΦ t−1 as a proxy for the
class distribution across previously learned categories. During each training iteration, the previous modelΦ t−1 is applied to the current inputP
to generate pseudo-labels ˜Yt , from which we accumulate class-wise frequency statistics for
previously learned classes. LetC1:t = St
i=1 Ci represent the union of all classes seen up to task
t. At the end of each epoch, we compute the overall class frequencyf∈R |C1:t | by combining
the pseudo-label distribution ˜pt (c)derived from ˜Yt with the ground-truth label distribution
pt (c)from the current task. The resulting frequency vectorf= [f(c)] c∈C1:t is then used to
compute class-wise weightsw= [w(c)] c∈C1:t , which guide balanced pseudo-label selection
and help the model focus on rare classes. In the next epoch, the modelΦ t−1 produces soft pseudo-label predictions ˜Yt (as de-
scribed in PLG) , where each component ˜Yt [c]denotes the confidence score for classc∈
C1:t−1. To promote balanced pseudo-label selection, class-wise re-weighting is applied using
w(c) = 1
f(c)+ε , whereεis a small constant for numerical stability. The adjusted predictions
are computed by applying the class-wise weights as: ˜Yt,w [c] =w(c)· ˜Yt [c],∀c∈ C 1:t−1. Top-Kselection is then applied to both the original and the re-weighted scores, yielding
two pseudo-label sets: ˜Yt
K and ˜Yt,w
K , respectively. The final augmented target set, Yt , is
constructed by concatenating the ground-truth labelsY t with both sets of pseudo-labels:
Yt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt
K ∥ ˜Yt,w
K .(2)
Although the above re-weighting mitigates bias from prior tasks, it does not address class
imbalance within the current taskt. To resolve this, the class-balanced weightsw c are ex-
tended to incorporate statistics from both previously seen and current classes, i.e., overC 1:t
rather than onlyC 1:t−1. The updated weights, denoted asw ′
c, are used to re-weights both
pseudo-label selection and classification loss, ensuring balanced supervision across all seen
categories, including rare ones. This unified strategy reduces bias and enhances performance
across phases. The pseudo-code for constructing the supervision set in Eq. (2), which incor-
porates both PLG and CBR components, is provided in Appendix A. Final Objective.The final training objective ofCLIMB-3D, incorporating ER, PLG, and THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D7

While CI-3DIS methods offer a wide range of practical applications, they frequently rely
on the assumption of uniform sample distribution, which rarely holds in real-world settings. In practice, the number of object categories, denoted byC, is often large and characterised
by substantial variability in category frequency, shape, structure, and size. To address these
challenges, we propose three incremental learning scenarios, each designed to capture a
different facet of real-world complexity. The design of these scenarios is detailed below; for
further information and illustrations, refer to Appendix E of the supplementary material. Split-A: Frequency Scenarios.This scenario acknowledges that datasets are often la-
belled based on the frequency of categories. To accommodate this, we propose a split where
the model learns from the most frequent categories and subsequently incorporates the less
frequent ones in later stages. By prioritising the training of frequently occurring categories,
the model can establish a strong foundation before expanding to handle rare categories. Split-B: Semantic Scenarios.Beyond frequency, semantic similarity is crucial in real-
world deployments. While objects often share visual or functional traits, models may en-
counter semantically different categories in new environments. To simulate this challenge,
we introduce theSplit-Bscenario. Here, categories are grouped based on their semantic
relationships, and the model is incrementally trained on one semantic group at a time. This
setup encourages the model to generalise across semantically similar categories and adapt
more effectively when exposed to new ones. Unlike theSplit-Ascenario, which organises
learning based on category frequency, theSplit-Bscenario may contain both frequent and
infrequent categories within a single task, focusing on semantic continuity and transfer. Split-C: Random Scenarios.In some cases, data labelling is driven by the availability of
objects rather than predefined criteria. To capture this, we introduce theSplit-Cscenario,
which represents a fully random setting where any class can appear in any task, resulting in
varying levels of class imbalance. By exposing the model to such diverse and unpredictable
distributions, we aim to improve its robustness in real-world situations where labelled data
availability is inconsistent. These incremental scenarios are designed to provide a more realistic representation of
object distributions, frequencies, and dynamics encountered in the real world. 4 Experiments

assessing real-world scenarios. In addition, we compare our approach against existing in-
cremental learning methods using ScanNetV2 [16] in the 3DSS setting. For this evaluation,
we follow the standard training and validation splits defined in prior works [74] to ensure
consistency with existing methods. Evaluation Metrics.We evaluate our method usingMean Average Precision(mAP), a
standard metric for 3DIS which provides a comprehensive measure of segmentation quality
by accounting for both precision and recall. For comparison with existing 3DSS methods,
we report themean Intersection over Union(mIoU), which quantifies the overlap between
predicted and ground truth segments. To assess the model’s ability to mitigate catastrophic
forgetting in incremental settings, we use theForgetting Percentage Points(FPP) metric, as
defined in [47]. FPP captures performance degradation by measuring the accuracy drop on
the initially seen categories between the first and final training phases. Detailed descriptions of the incremental scenarios (Split-A,Split-B,Split-C) and im-
plementation are provided in Appendix B. 4.2 Results and Discussion

To evaluate our proposed approach, we construct a baseline using ER [5] for the 3DIS
setting, as no existing incremental baselines are available for this task. In contrast, for the
3DSS setting, where incremental baselines do exist, we compare our method against three
prior approaches [43, 60, 74]. Results on CI-3DIS.Tab. 1 compares CLIMB-3D against the ER baseline across the three
CI-3DIS scenarios, evaluated after all phases using mAP 25, mAP50, overall mAP, and FPP. In theSplit-Ascenario, characterised by significant distribution shifts, our method achieves
gains of +19.23%, +16.76%, and +12.28% in mAP 25, mAP 50, and overall mAP, respec-
tively, while drastically reducing forgetting with FPP scores of 3.44% (mAP 25) and 2.63%
(mAP50), both over 45 points lower than the baseline. Under theSplit-Bscenario, with
semantically related new categories, improvements of +18.26%, +16.49%, and +12.76%
are observed alongside a reduction in forgetting to 8.00% and 5.51% from baseline levels
above 42%. For theSplit-Cscenario, featuring increasing geometric complexity, CLIMB-
3D maintains solid gains of +5.94%, +5.70%, and +4.08% across mAP metrics, with forget-
ting reduced by over 22 points. Overall, these results demonstrate robust forward transfer,
minimal forgetting, and stable learning, highlighting the method’s effectiveness for scalable
continual 3D semantic understanding. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D9

Results on CI-3DSS.Although our primary focus is on CI-3DIS, we also evaluate our
method under the CI-3DSS setting to enable comparisons with existing approaches. To do
so, we adapt our predictions to assign each point the label corresponding to the highest-
confidence mask and exclude background classes (e.g., floor and wall), as these are not part
of the semantic segmentation targets. Tab. 2 presents a comparison between our method and
existing baselines on the ScanNet V2 dataset [16], evaluated using mIoU across two training
phases and overall. Although originally designed for instance segmentation, our method
generalises effectively to semantic segmentation, achieving substantial gains of +35.23%
mIoU in Phase 1 and +19.1% in Phase 2. Overall, it achieves 59.38% mIoU, significantly
higher than the∼30% mIoU of prior methods, highlighting its robustness and transferability. Refer to Appendix C, D, and F of the supplementary material for detailed analyses of per-
phase performance, rare-class evaluation, and qualitative result comparisons, respectively. 4.3 Ablation

We conduct an ablation study to evaluate the contribution of each component in our
framework. As an upper bound, we report the performance of anOraclemodel, which is
trained jointly on the full dataset. For the incremental setting, we follow the previously
defined splits and first train the model naively across phases. We then incrementally add
each module to isolate its impact. Tab. 3 presents results for theSplit-Ascenario using both
mAP50 and FPP metrics. Naïve Training.When trained naïvely without any dedicated modules, the model suffers
from severe catastrophic forgetting, as evident in row 2. The model entirely forgets pre-
viously learned classes upon entering new phases, with performance dropping to zero for
earlier splits and FPP rising to 56.82. 10THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D
Effect of ER.Adding exemplar replay (row 3) partially alleviates forgetting by maintaining
a buffer of past examples. This yields notable gains fors1in Phase 2 (+18.51%) and Phase 3
(+10.38%), and also improvess2in Phase 3 (+9.43%). However, the overall forgetting
remains substantial (FPP: 46.44), showing ER alone is insufficient. Effect of PLG.The addition of the pseudo-label generator (PLG), which generates labels for
previous classes by retaining a copy of the model from an earlier phase, facilitates knowledge
retention and forward transfer. As shown in row 4, PLG significantly reduces forgetting and
enhances performance on current tasks. Fors1, it improves mAP 50 by 31.49% in Phase 2
and 39.40% in Phase 3 over exemplar replay. Overall, PLG yields a 15.00% increase in
performance and reduces forgetting by 39.40%. Effect of CBR.Finally, class-balanced re-weighting (CBR) mitigates class imbalance dur-

trade-off between retaining past knowledge and acquiring new tasks, outperforming PLG
and ER by 4.41% and 43.81%, respectively. 4.4 Limitations & Future Work
While CLIMB-3D achieves strong performance across CI-3DIS and CI-3DSS settings, sev-
eral limitations remain and warrant discussion. The experiments are currently limited to
indoor datasets (ScanNet200 and ScanNetV2), therefore evaluating performance on outdoor
scenes would help assess generalisability across diverse environments. The current setup
also considers only three incremental phases, whereas real-world applications often involve
longer sequences; incorporating such extended setups would better reflect practical chal-
lenges. Moreover, the model operates in a uni-modal setting. Integrating multi-modal cues,
such as vision-language models, could further enhance performance, as suggested by recent
2D and 3D studies [25, 65, 66]. 5 Conclusion
This work addresses the challenge of catastrophic forgetting in class-incremental 3D in-
stance segmentation by introducing a modular framework that integrates exemplar replay
(ER), a pseudo-label generator (PLG), and class-balanced re-weighting (CBR). The pro-
posed method incrementally adapts to new classes while preserving prior knowledge, all
without requiring access to the full dataset. Extensive experiments on a three-phase bench-
mark validate the individual and combined effectiveness of each component: ER enables
efficient memory-based retention; PLG facilitates knowledge preservation through pseudo-
supervision; and CBR mitigates class imbalance to enhance learning stability. Together,
these components significantly reduce forgetting and improve segmentation performance
across all phases. By achieving a strong balance between stability and plasticity, our ap-
proach advances continual 3D scene understanding and sets a new baseline for future re-
search in this area. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D11

whilePhase 3targets even less frequent classes, with observations limited to 1–10 times per

model shows improvement throughout the phase. In Phase 3 of (s2), although both the base-

trend is observed in Phase 3, where our method not only consistently improves learning but
also enhances retention of previous information. After all three tasks, our method achieves
an overall performance of 31.56% AP50, compared to 15.07% for the baseline. In theSplit-

1 Introduction
Table Chair Couch Pillow Coffee Table Sofa Chair Recycling BinCabinet Unknown
Task-1 Task-2 Task-3
Figure 1:Overview of the CI-3DIS setting.New object categories are introduced incre-
mentally with each task. After every phase, the model must recognise both newly added
and previously learned classes. For instance, in Task 2, categories such asPillow,Coffee
Table, andSofa Chairare introduced, while the model is expected to retain recognition
of earlier classes likeTable,Chair, andCouch. 3D instance segmentation (3DIS) is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves
identifying precise object boundaries and class labels in 3D space, with broad applications in
graphics, robotics, and augmented reality [4, 39]. Traditional 3DIS methods, including top-
down [28, 70, 78], bottom-up [26, 73], and transformer-based approaches [59], perform well
under the assumption that all classes are available and balanced during training. However,
this assumption does not hold in real-world environments, where new object classes emerge
over time and exhibit natural imbalance. This gap motivates the need for Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) [17, 54], which sup-
ports learning new categories while retaining knowledge of previous ones [51]. While CIL
has seen success in 2D image tasks [1, 43, 54, 60], extensions to 3D point clouds remain
limited, often focusing on object-level classification [13, 18, 48]. Recent works on scene-
level class-incremental 3DIS (CI-3DIS) [4] and class-incremental semantic segmentation
(CI-3DSS) [74] show promise, but depend heavily on large exemplar [56] and overlook class
imbalance, limiting their practicality. To address this, we proposeCLIMB-3D, a unified framework forCLass-incremental
IMBalance-aware3DIS that jointly tackles catastrophic forgetting and class imbalance. The
framework begins with Exemplar Replay (ER), storing a small number of samples from
past classes for later replay. However, this alone does not yield promising results under the
strict memory constraints required in CI-3DIS. To address this, we introduce a Pseudo-Label
Generator (PLG), which uses a frozen model from previous task to generate supervision for
earlier classes. However, we observed that PLG tends to favour frequent classes while ig-
noring under-represented ones. To mitigate this, we propose a Class-Balanced Re-weighting
(CBR), which estimates class frequencies from the pseudo-labels to enhance the learning of
rare classes without accessing past data. Together, these components form a practical and
effective solution for real-world 3DIS. To evaluate CLIMB-3D, we designed three benchmark scenarios for CI-3DIS based on
the ScanNet200 dataset [57]. These scenarios simulate incremental learning setup under nat-
ural class imbalance, where new classes emerge based on (A) object frequency, (B) semantic
similarity, or (C) random grouping. Additionally, for comparison with existing methods,
we evaluate our approach on CI-3DSS using the ScanNetV2 dataset [16]. Experimental re-
sults show that our method significantly reduces forgetting and improves performance across
both frequent and rare categories, outperforming previous methods in both settings. Fig. 1
illustrates the CI-3DIS setup. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D3
In summary, our contributions are: (i) a novel problem setting of imbalanced class-
incremental 3DIS with an effective method to balance learning and mitigate forgetting; (ii)
three benchmarks modelling continual object emergence with natural imbalance; and (iii)
strong experimental results, achieving up to 16.76% mAP improvement over baselines. 2 Related Work
3D Instance Segmentation.Various methods have been proposed for 3DIS. Grouping-
based approaches adopt a bottom-up pipeline that learns latent embeddings for point cluster-
ing [9, 21, 22, 29, 37, 44, 70, 78]. In contrast, proposal-based methods follow a top-down
strategy by detecting 3D boxes and segmenting objects within them [19, 26, 46, 73, 76]. Recently, transformer-based models [68] have also been applied to 3DIS and 3DSS [59, 64],
inspired by advances in 2D vision [10, 11]. However, these approaches require full anno-
tations for all classes and are not designed for progressive learning, where only new class
annotations are available and previous data is inaccessible. Another line of work aims to re-
duce annotation costs by proposing weakly supervised 3DIS methods based on sparse cues
[12, 27, 72]. While effective with limited annotations, these methods assume a fixed set of
classes and are susceptible to catastrophic forgetting in incremental settings. Incremental Learning.Continual learning involves training models sequentially to miti-
gate catastrophic forgetting. One common strategy is model regularisation, which constrains
parameter updates using techniques such as elastic weight consolidation or knowledge dis-
tillation [1, 24, 35, 43, 60]. Another approach is exemplar replay, where past data is stored
or generated to rehearse older tasks while learning new ones [5, 7, 30, 54]. A third direc-
tion involves dynamically expanding the model architecture or using modular sub-networks
to accommodate new tasks without interfering with old ones [31, 42, 53, 58, 71, 79]. Re-
cent efforts in class-incremental 3D segmentation [63, 74] have shown early promise but
often rely on basic architectures and focus primarily on semantic segmentation. Other works
[4, 36] explore continual learning in 3D settings, though they often depend on large memory
buffers. In contrast, our work introduces a tailored framework for 3D instance segmentation
that effectively transfers knowledge across tasks, even under class imbalance. Long-tailed Recognition.Imbalanced class distributions lead to poor recognition of rare
(long-tail) classes. To address this, re-sampling methods balance the data via input [8, 20, 50,
52, 61] or feature space [3, 14, 40], avoiding naïve under-/over-sampling. Loss re-weighting
offers another direction, using class-based [6, 15, 23, 32, 33, 69] or per-example [45, 55, 62]
adjustments to ensure fair contribution. Parameter regularisation improves generalisation
through weight constraints [2], albeit requiring careful tuning. Other approaches leverage
transfer learning [77, 81], self-supervision [41, 75], or contrastive learning [34, 41, 82] to
improve rare-class representations. Long-tailed recognition is well-studied in 2D with large-
scale datasets [15, 49, 67]; in 3D, ScanNet200 [16, 57] enables similar efforts. Prior 3D
work focused on re-weighting, re-sampling, and transfer learning [57], while regularisation
remains underexplored. CeCo [80] balances class centres via auxiliary loss but overlooks
sampling and augmentation. Lahoud et al. [38] propose adaptive classifier regularisation
for 3D segmentation, outperforming prior approaches without threshold tuning. However,
neither method considers incremental learning. In contrast, we jointly address long-tail and
continual 3D semantic segmentation. 4THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D

Figure 2: Overview ofCLIMB-3Dfor CI-3DIS. The model incrementally learns new classes
across sequential phases. During taskt, point cloudsPand their corresponding labelsY t are
sampled from a combination of the current training datasetD t and Exemplar Replay (ER),
which maintains a small memory of past examples. These are then passed to the current
modelΦ t to produce predicted labelsY t . The Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG) selects the
top-Kpredictions from the previous modelΦ t−1 . These pseudo-labels are then weighted
based on class frequencyf(c)using Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR), and the top-Kre-
weighted labels are selected to form the balanced pseudo-label set ¯Yt . This pseudo-label set
is then concatenated with the ground-truth labels to form a final augmented supervision set
Yt for taskt, which is used to optimise the modelΦ t using Eq. (3). 3 Methodology
3.1 Problem Formulation
3DIS.The objective of this task is to detect and segment each object instance within a point
cloud. Formally, the training dataset is denoted asD={(P i,Yi)}N
i=1, whereNis the number
of training samples. Each inputP i ∈R M×6 is a coloured point cloud consisting ofMpoints,
where each point is represented by its 3D coordinates and RGB values. The corresponding
annotationY i ={(m i,j ,ci,j )}Ji
j=1 containsJ i object instances, wheremi,j ∈ {0,1}M is a binary
mask indicating which points belong to thej-th instance, andc i,j ∈ C={1,...,C}is the
semantic class label of that instance. GivenP i, the modelΦpredicts instance-level outputs
ˆYi ={(ˆmi,j ,ˆci,j )}
ˆJi
j=1, where ˆmi,j and ˆci,j denote the predicted mask and category label for
thej-th instance, respectively. The number of predicted instances ˆJi varies depending on the
model’s inference. The model is optimised using the following objective:
L3DIS(D;Φ) = 1

(P,Y)∈D

|Y| ∑
(mj,cj)∈Y
(Lmask(mj,ˆmj)+λ·L cls(cj,ˆcj)),(1)
whereL cls andL mask are the average classification and mask losses over all instances, andλ
controls their trade-off. CI-3DIS.Unlike conventional 3DIS, CI-3DIS involves sequential learning, where object
categories are introduced incrementally overTtraining tasks. Each tasktintroduces a dis-
joint set of classesC t , withC= ST

encountered in previous tasks, despite limited supervision and the absence of past labels. 3.2 Method: CLIMB-3D
Overview.As shown in Fig. 2 and formulated in Sec. 3.1, the proposed framework for
CI-3DIS follows aphase-wisetraining strategy. In each phase, the model is exposed to a
carefully curated subset of the dataset, simulating real-world scenarios discussed in Sec. 3.3. Training naïvely on such phased data leads tocatastrophic forgetting[51], where the model
forgets prior knowledge when learning new tasks. To address this, we first incorporateEx-
emplar Replay(ER) [5], a strategy inspired by 2D incremental methods [1, 43, 54] and
recently extended to 3D settings [4], to mitigate forgetting by storing a small set of repre-
sentative samples from earlier phases. However, ER alone is insufficient to achieve robust
performance. To address this, two additional components are introduced: aPseudo-Label
Generator(PLG), which leverages a frozen model to generate supervision signals for previ-
ously seen classes, and aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) module that compensates for
class imbalance across phases. Each of these components is described in detail below 1. Exemplar Replay (ER).Inspired by Buzzega et al. [5], ER addresses the issue of catas-
trophic forgetting by allowing the model to retain a subset of data from earlier phases. During phaset, the model is trained not only on the current task dataD t , but also on a
set of exemplarsE 1:t−1, collected from previous phases. These exemplars are accumulated
incrementally:E 1:t−1 =E 1 ∪···∪E t−1 .Here,E t denotes the exemplar subset stored after
phaset, and|E t |denotes the exemplar replay size. The combined replay dataset is denoted
as:D t
ER =D t ∪E 1:t−1.Epoch training consists of two stages: first, the model is trained on
the current data,D t ; then it is trained using exemplars fromE 1:t−1. While previous CI-3DIS approaches rely on large exemplar sets to mitigate forgetting [4],
such strategies become impractical under memory constraints. Consequently, although ER
aids knowledge retention, it is insufficient on its own for robust performance with a limited
exemplar budget. Therefore, PLG and CBR are introduced to better preserve past represen-
tations and enhance generalisation across phases. Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG).In the CI-3DIS setting, during phaset(wheret>1),
although ground-truth labels for previously seen classes are unavailable, the model from the
previous phaseΦ t−1 , which preserves knowledge of past tasks, is retained. We use this
model to generate pseudo-labels for previously seen classes, thereby providing approximate
supervision during training. This allows the current modelΦt , to retain prior knowledge and
reduce forgetting, even without access to ground-truth annotations. Given a point cloud and label pair(P,Y t ), fromD t , the previous modelΦ t−1 , generates
pseudo-labels for the previously seen classes as ˆY1:t−1 =Φ t−1 (P), which we denote as ˜Yt
1For clarity, modifications introduced by each component (ER, PLG, and CBR) are highlighted in green, blue,
and red, respectively. 6THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D
for brevity. However, we observe that utilising all predictions fromΦt−1 introduces noisy or
incorrect labels, which degrade overall performance. To mitigate this, we select the top-K
most confident instance predictions, denoted as ˜Yt
K, and concatenate them with the ground-
truth labels of the current task to obtain the supervision set: ¯Yt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt
K. Following this,
the loss is computed over both the current task’s ground-truth labels and the top-Kconfi-
dent pseudo-labels from earlier phases, enabling the model to retain prior knowledge while
adapting to new classes. Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR).While ER and PLG contribute to preserving prior
knowledge, we observe that the model’s predictions are biased towards frequent classes,
resulting in the forgetting of rare categories. This issue is further amplified by the top-K
pseudo-labels selected by PLG, which predominantly represent dominant classes in the data. To address this, we propose aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) scheme that compensates
for class imbalance using object frequency statistics. At taskt, only the current datasetD t
and its label distributionp t (c)over classesc∈ Ct are available. Datasets and class distribu-
tions from earlier tasks{D i,p i(c)}t−1
i=1 are no longer accessible, which makes it challenging
to directly account for class imbalance across all previously seen tasks. Therefore, we pro-
pose to leverage the pseudo-label predictions of the frozen modelΦ t−1 as a proxy for the
class distribution across previously learned categories. During each training iteration, the previous modelΦ t−1 is applied to the current inputP
to generate pseudo-labels ˜Yt , from which we accumulate class-wise frequency statistics for
previously learned classes. LetC1:t = St
i=1 Ci represent the union of all classes seen up to task
t. At the end of each epoch, we compute the overall class frequencyf∈R |C1:t | by combining
the pseudo-label distribution ˜pt (c)derived from ˜Yt with the ground-truth label distribution
pt (c)from the current task. The resulting frequency vectorf= [f(c)] c∈C1:t is then used to
compute class-wise weightsw= [w(c)] c∈C1:t , which guide balanced pseudo-label selection
and help the model focus on rare classes. In the next epoch, the modelΦ t−1 produces soft pseudo-label predictions ˜Yt (as de-
scribed in PLG) , where each component ˜Yt [c]denotes the confidence score for classc∈
C1:t−1. To promote balanced pseudo-label selection, class-wise re-weighting is applied using
w(c) = 1
f(c)+ε , whereεis a small constant for numerical stability. The adjusted predictions
are computed by applying the class-wise weights as: ˜Yt,w [c] =w(c)· ˜Yt [c],∀c∈ C 1:t−1. Top-Kselection is then applied to both the original and the re-weighted scores, yielding
two pseudo-label sets: ˜Yt
K and ˜Yt,w
K , respectively. The final augmented target set, Yt , is
constructed by concatenating the ground-truth labelsY t with both sets of pseudo-labels:
Yt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt
K ∥ ˜Yt,w
K .(2)
Although the above re-weighting mitigates bias from prior tasks, it does not address class
imbalance within the current taskt. To resolve this, the class-balanced weightsw c are ex-
tended to incorporate statistics from both previously seen and current classes, i.e., overC 1:t
rather than onlyC 1:t−1. The updated weights, denoted asw ′
c, are used to re-weights both
pseudo-label selection and classification loss, ensuring balanced supervision across all seen
categories, including rare ones. This unified strategy reduces bias and enhances performance
across phases. The pseudo-code for constructing the supervision set in Eq. (2), which incor-
porates both PLG and CBR components, is provided in Appendix A. Final Objective.The final training objective ofCLIMB-3D, incorporating ER, PLG, and THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D7

While CI-3DIS methods offer a wide range of practical applications, they frequently rely
on the assumption of uniform sample distribution, which rarely holds in real-world settings. In practice, the number of object categories, denoted byC, is often large and characterised
by substantial variability in category frequency, shape, structure, and size. To address these
challenges, we propose three incremental learning scenarios, each designed to capture a
different facet of real-world complexity. The design of these scenarios is detailed below; for
further information and illustrations, refer to Appendix E of the supplementary material. Split-A: Frequency Scenarios.This scenario acknowledges that datasets are often la-
belled based on the frequency of categories. To accommodate this, we propose a split where
the model learns from the most frequent categories and subsequently incorporates the less
frequent ones in later stages. By prioritising the training of frequently occurring categories,
the model can establish a strong foundation before expanding to handle rare categories. Split-B: Semantic Scenarios.Beyond frequency, semantic similarity is crucial in real-
world deployments. While objects often share visual or functional traits, models may en-
counter semantically different categories in new environments. To simulate this challenge,
we introduce theSplit-Bscenario. Here, categories are grouped based on their semantic
relationships, and the model is incrementally trained on one semantic group at a time. This
setup encourages the model to generalise across semantically similar categories and adapt
more effectively when exposed to new ones. Unlike theSplit-Ascenario, which organises
learning based on category frequency, theSplit-Bscenario may contain both frequent and
infrequent categories within a single task, focusing on semantic continuity and transfer. Split-C: Random Scenarios.In some cases, data labelling is driven by the availability of
objects rather than predefined criteria. To capture this, we introduce theSplit-Cscenario,
which represents a fully random setting where any class can appear in any task, resulting in
varying levels of class imbalance. By exposing the model to such diverse and unpredictable
distributions, we aim to improve its robustness in real-world situations where labelled data
availability is inconsistent. These incremental scenarios are designed to provide a more realistic representation of
object distributions, frequencies, and dynamics encountered in the real world. 4 Experiments

assessing real-world scenarios. In addition, we compare our approach against existing in-
cremental learning methods using ScanNetV2 [16] in the 3DSS setting. For this evaluation,
we follow the standard training and validation splits defined in prior works [74] to ensure
consistency with existing methods. Evaluation Metrics.We evaluate our method usingMean Average Precision(mAP), a
standard metric for 3DIS which provides a comprehensive measure of segmentation quality
by accounting for both precision and recall. For comparison with existing 3DSS methods,
we report themean Intersection over Union(mIoU), which quantifies the overlap between
predicted and ground truth segments. To assess the model’s ability to mitigate catastrophic
forgetting in incremental settings, we use theForgetting Percentage Points(FPP) metric, as
defined in [47]. FPP captures performance degradation by measuring the accuracy drop on
the initially seen categories between the first and final training phases. Detailed descriptions of the incremental scenarios (Split-A,Split-B,Split-C) and im-
plementation are provided in Appendix B. 4.2 Results and Discussion

To evaluate our proposed approach, we construct a baseline using ER [5] for the 3DIS
setting, as no existing incremental baselines are available for this task. In contrast, for the
3DSS setting, where incremental baselines do exist, we compare our method against three
prior approaches [43, 60, 74]. Results on CI-3DIS.Tab. 1 compares CLIMB-3D against the ER baseline across the three
CI-3DIS scenarios, evaluated after all phases using mAP 25, mAP50, overall mAP, and FPP. In theSplit-Ascenario, characterised by significant distribution shifts, our method achieves
gains of +19.23%, +16.76%, and +12.28% in mAP 25, mAP 50, and overall mAP, respec-
tively, while drastically reducing forgetting with FPP scores of 3.44% (mAP 25) and 2.63%
(mAP50), both over 45 points lower than the baseline. Under theSplit-Bscenario, with
semantically related new categories, improvements of +18.26%, +16.49%, and +12.76%
are observed alongside a reduction in forgetting to 8.00% and 5.51% from baseline levels
above 42%. For theSplit-Cscenario, featuring increasing geometric complexity, CLIMB-
3D maintains solid gains of +5.94%, +5.70%, and +4.08% across mAP metrics, with forget-
ting reduced by over 22 points. Overall, these results demonstrate robust forward transfer,
minimal forgetting, and stable learning, highlighting the method’s effectiveness for scalable
continual 3D semantic understanding. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D9

Results on CI-3DSS.Although our primary focus is on CI-3DIS, we also evaluate our
method under the CI-3DSS setting to enable comparisons with existing approaches. To do
so, we adapt our predictions to assign each point the label corresponding to the highest-
confidence mask and exclude background classes (e.g., floor and wall), as these are not part
of the semantic segmentation targets. Tab. 2 presents a comparison between our method and
existing baselines on the ScanNet V2 dataset [16], evaluated using mIoU across two training
phases and overall. Although originally designed for instance segmentation, our method
generalises effectively to semantic segmentation, achieving substantial gains of +35.23%
mIoU in Phase 1 and +19.1% in Phase 2. Overall, it achieves 59.38% mIoU, significantly
higher than the∼30% mIoU of prior methods, highlighting its robustness and transferability. Refer to Appendix C, D, and F of the supplementary material for detailed analyses of per-
phase performance, rare-class evaluation, and qualitative result comparisons, respectively. 4.3 Ablation

We conduct an ablation study to evaluate the contribution of each component in our
framework. As an upper bound, we report the performance of anOraclemodel, which is
trained jointly on the full dataset. For the incremental setting, we follow the previously
defined splits and first train the model naively across phases. We then incrementally add
each module to isolate its impact. Tab. 3 presents results for theSplit-Ascenario using both
mAP50 and FPP metrics. Naïve Training.When trained naïvely without any dedicated modules, the model suffers
from severe catastrophic forgetting, as evident in row 2. The model entirely forgets pre-
viously learned classes upon entering new phases, with performance dropping to zero for
earlier splits and FPP rising to 56.82. 10THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D
Effect of ER.Adding exemplar replay (row 3) partially alleviates forgetting by maintaining
a buffer of past examples. This yields notable gains fors1in Phase 2 (+18.51%) and Phase 3
(+10.38%), and also improvess2in Phase 3 (+9.43%). However, the overall forgetting
remains substantial (FPP: 46.44), showing ER alone is insufficient. Effect of PLG.The addition of the pseudo-label generator (PLG), which generates labels for
previous classes by retaining a copy of the model from an earlier phase, facilitates knowledge
retention and forward transfer. As shown in row 4, PLG significantly reduces forgetting and
enhances performance on current tasks. Fors1, it improves mAP 50 by 31.49% in Phase 2
and 39.40% in Phase 3 over exemplar replay. Overall, PLG yields a 15.00% increase in
performance and reduces forgetting by 39.40%. Effect of CBR.Finally, class-balanced re-weighting (CBR) mitigates class imbalance dur-
ing both pseudo-labelling and current task learning by adjusting each class’s contribution
based on its frequency. As shown in row 5, CBR enhancess1retention over PLG in Phases 2
and 3 (+4.67% and +4.41%), and further improves performance ons2ands3. It also achieves
the lowest FPP of 2.63, reflecting strong forgetting mitigation. Overall, CBR offers the best
trade-off between retaining past knowledge and acquiring new tasks, outperforming PLG
and ER by 4.41% and 43.81%, respectively. 4.4 Limitations & Future Work
While CLIMB-3D achieves strong performance across CI-3DIS and CI-3DSS settings, sev-
eral limitations remain and warrant discussion. The experiments are currently limited to
indoor datasets (ScanNet200 and ScanNetV2), therefore evaluating performance on outdoor
scenes would help assess generalisability across diverse environments. The current setup
also considers only three incremental phases, whereas real-world applications often involve
longer sequences; incorporating such extended setups would better reflect practical chal-
lenges. Moreover, the model operates in a uni-modal setting. Integrating multi-modal cues,
such as vision-language models, could further enhance performance, as suggested by recent
2D and 3D studies [25, 65, 66]. 5 Conclusion
This work addresses the challenge of catastrophic forgetting in class-incremental 3D in-
stance segmentation by introducing a modular framework that integrates exemplar replay
(ER), a pseudo-label generator (PLG), and class-balanced re-weighting (CBR). The pro-
posed method incrementally adapts to new classes while preserving prior knowledge, all
without requiring access to the full dataset. Extensive experiments on a three-phase bench-
mark validate the individual and combined effectiveness of each component: ER enables
efficient memory-based retention; PLG facilitates knowledge preservation through pseudo-
supervision; and CBR mitigates class imbalance to enhance learning stability. Together,
these components significantly reduce forgetting and improve segmentation performance
across all phases. By achieving a strong balance between stability and plasticity, our ap-
proach advances continual 3D scene understanding and sets a new baseline for future re-
search in this area. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D11

We extend the analysis from Tab."
What is the focus of the supplementary material provided in the document chunk?,"In this supplementary material, we first demonstrate the performance gains on rare classes achieved by incorporating the IC module in Appendix C. Next, we provide detailed split information for all scenarios, based on class names, in Appendix D. Finally, we present a qualitative comparison between the baseline method and our proposed approach in Appendix E.","1 to Tab. 4 to highlight the impact of our proposed method
on individual splits across various scenarios. The results clearly demonstrate that our model
consistently retains knowledge of previous tasks better than the baseline. ForSplit-A, our
model shows improvement throughout the phase. In Phase 3 of (s2), although both the base-
line and our method exhibit a performance drop, our method reduces forgetting significantly

We extend the analysis from Tab.

In this supplementary material, we first demonstrate the performance gains on rare classes achieved by incorporating the IC module in Appendix C. Next, we provide detailed split information for all scenarios, based on class names, in Appendix D. Finally, we present a qualitative comparison between the baseline method and our proposed approach in Appendix E.

2andPhase 3, respectively. InPhase 2, we evaluate classes seen 1–20 times per epoch,
whilePhase 3targets even less frequent classes, with observations limited to 1–10 times per
epoch. As illustrated in Tab. 5, the IC module substantially improves performance on rare
classes in terms of mAP 50 in Phase 2 ofSplit-A. For instance, classes likerecycling
binandtrash bin, seen only 3 and 7 times, respectively, shows significant improvement
when the IC module is applied. Overall, the IC module provides an average boost of 8.32%,
highlighting its effectiveness in mitigating class imbalance. Similarly, Tab. 6 presents results forPhase 3, demonstrating significant gains for infre-
quent classes. For example, even though the classes such aspiano,bucket, andlaundry
basketare observed only once, IC module improves the performance by 52.30%, 10.40%,
and 13.60%, respectively. The ER+KD module does not focus on rare classes likeshower

How does the IC module impact the performance of infrequent classes in Phase 3?,"Similarly, Tab. 6 presents results for Phase 3, demonstrating significant gains for infrequent classes. For example, even though the classes such as piano, bucket, and laundry basket are observed only once, IC module improves the performance by 52.30%, 10.40%, and 13.60%, respectively.","Similarly, Tab. 6 presents results for Phase 3, demonstrating significant gains for infrequent classes.

1 to Tab. 4 to highlight the impact of our proposed method
on individual splits across various scenarios. The results clearly demonstrate that our model
consistently retains knowledge of previous tasks better than the baseline. ForSplit-A, our
model shows improvement throughout the phase. In Phase 3 of (s2), although both the base-
line and our method exhibit a performance drop, our method reduces forgetting significantly
compared to the baseline. TheSplit-Bscenario, while more complex thanSplit-A, achieves
comparable results due to semantic similarity among classes within the same task. In Phase
2, our model achieves overall all 43.13% mAP50 compared to 24.53% on baseline, a similar
trend is observed in Phase 3, where our method not only consistently improves learning but
also enhances retention of previous information. After all three tasks, our method achieves
an overall performance of 31.56% AP50, compared to 15.07% for the baseline. In theSplit-
Cscenario, the first-stage model struggles due to the increased complexity introduced by
random grouping. In Phase 2, while the baseline focuses on learning the current task, it suf-
fers from severe forgetting of prior knowledge. Conversely, our method balances new task
learning with the retention of earlier information. By Phase 3, the model effectively con- 2THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D

E. Appendix C Evaluation on Rare Categories
The proposed imbalance correction (IC) module, as detailed in Section 4.2, is designed to
address the performance gap for rare classes. To assess its impact, we compare its perfor-
mance with the framework which has exemplar replay (ER) and knowledge distillation (KD). Specifically, we focus on its ability to improve performance for rare classes, which the model
encounters infrequently compared to more common classes. The results, shown in Tab.

5 and Tab. 6, correspond to evaluations onSplit-AforPhase
2andPhase 3, respectively. InPhase 2, we evaluate classes seen 1–20 times per epoch,
whilePhase 3targets even less frequent classes, with observations limited to 1–10 times per
epoch. As illustrated in Tab. 5, the IC module substantially improves performance on rare
classes in terms of mAP 50 in Phase 2 ofSplit-A. For instance, classes likerecycling
binandtrash bin, seen only 3 and 7 times, respectively, shows significant improvement
when the IC module is applied. Overall, the IC module provides an average boost of 8.32%,
highlighting its effectiveness in mitigating class imbalance. Similarly, Tab. 6 presents results forPhase 3, demonstrating significant gains for infre-
quent classes. For example, even though the classes such aspiano,bucket, andlaundry
basketare observed only once, IC module improves the performance by 52.30%, 10.40%,
and 13.60%, respectively. The ER+KD module does not focus on rare classes likeshower

ance by focusing on underrepresented categories. On average, the addition of the proposed THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D3

into three tasks: Task 1, Task 2, and Task 3. Notably, the order of classes in these tasks is

In this section, we present a qualitative comparison of the proposed framework with the
baseline method. Fig. 4 illustrates the results on theSplit-Aevaluation after learning all
tasks, comparing the performance of the baseline method and our proposed approach. As
shown in the figure, our method demonstrates superior instance segmentation performance
compared to the baseline. For example, in row 1, the baseline method fails to segment

outperforms the baseline, with several missed instances by the baseline highlighted in red 4THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D

mentally with each task. After every phase, the model must recognise both newly added
and previously learned classes. For instance, in Task 2, categories such asPillow,Coffee
Table, andSofa Chairare introduced, while the model is expected to retain recognition
of earlier classes likeTable,Chair, andCouch. 3D instance segmentation (3DIS) is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves
identifying precise object boundaries and class labels in 3D space, with broad applications in
graphics, robotics, and augmented reality [4, 39]. Traditional 3DIS methods, including top-
down [28, 70, 78], bottom-up [26, 73], and transformer-based approaches [59], perform well
under the assumption that all classes are available and balanced during training. However,
this assumption does not hold in real-world environments, where new object classes emerge
over time and exhibit natural imbalance. This gap motivates the need for Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) [17, 54], which sup-
ports learning new categories while retaining knowledge of previous ones [51]. While CIL
has seen success in 2D image tasks [1, 43, 54, 60], extensions to 3D point clouds remain
limited, often focusing on object-level classification [13, 18, 48]. Recent works on scene-
level class-incremental 3DIS (CI-3DIS) [4] and class-incremental semantic segmentation
(CI-3DSS) [74] show promise, but depend heavily on large exemplar [56] and overlook class
imbalance, limiting their practicality. To address this, we proposeCLIMB-3D, a unified framework forCLass-incremental
IMBalance-aware3DIS that jointly tackles catastrophic forgetting and class imbalance. The
framework begins with Exemplar Replay (ER), storing a small number of samples from
past classes for later replay. However, this alone does not yield promising results under the
strict memory constraints required in CI-3DIS. To address this, we introduce a Pseudo-Label
Generator (PLG), which uses a frozen model from previous task to generate supervision for
earlier classes. However, we observed that PLG tends to favour frequent classes while ig-
noring under-represented ones. To mitigate this, we propose a Class-Balanced Re-weighting
(CBR), which estimates class frequencies from the pseudo-labels to enhance the learning of
rare classes without accessing past data. Together, these components form a practical and
effective solution for real-world 3DIS. To evaluate CLIMB-3D, we designed three benchmark scenarios for CI-3DIS based on
the ScanNet200 dataset [57]. These scenarios simulate incremental learning setup under nat-
ural class imbalance, where new classes emerge based on (A) object frequency, (B) semantic
similarity, or (C) random grouping. Additionally, for comparison with existing methods,
we evaluate our approach on CI-3DSS using the ScanNetV2 dataset [16]. Experimental re-
sults show that our method significantly reduces forgetting and improves performance across
both frequent and rare categories, outperforming previous methods in both settings. Fig. 1
illustrates the CI-3DIS setup. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D3
In summary, our contributions are: (i) a novel problem setting of imbalanced class-
incremental 3DIS with an effective method to balance learning and mitigate forgetting; (ii)
three benchmarks modelling continual object emergence with natural imbalance; and (iii)
strong experimental results, achieving up to 16.76% mAP improvement over baselines. 2 Related Work
3D Instance Segmentation.Various methods have been proposed for 3DIS. Grouping-
based approaches adopt a bottom-up pipeline that learns latent embeddings for point cluster-
ing [9, 21, 22, 29, 37, 44, 70, 78]. In contrast, proposal-based methods follow a top-down
strategy by detecting 3D boxes and segmenting objects within them [19, 26, 46, 73, 76]. Recently, transformer-based models [68] have also been applied to 3DIS and 3DSS [59, 64],
inspired by advances in 2D vision [10, 11]. However, these approaches require full anno-
tations for all classes and are not designed for progressive learning, where only new class
annotations are available and previous data is inaccessible. Another line of work aims to re-
duce annotation costs by proposing weakly supervised 3DIS methods based on sparse cues
[12, 27, 72]. While effective with limited annotations, these methods assume a fixed set of
classes and are susceptible to catastrophic forgetting in incremental settings. Incremental Learning.Continual learning involves training models sequentially to miti-
gate catastrophic forgetting. One common strategy is model regularisation, which constrains
parameter updates using techniques such as elastic weight consolidation or knowledge dis-
tillation [1, 24, 35, 43, 60]. Another approach is exemplar replay, where past data is stored
or generated to rehearse older tasks while learning new ones [5, 7, 30, 54]. A third direc-
tion involves dynamically expanding the model architecture or using modular sub-networks
to accommodate new tasks without interfering with old ones [31, 42, 53, 58, 71, 79]. Re-
cent efforts in class-incremental 3D segmentation [63, 74] have shown early promise but
often rely on basic architectures and focus primarily on semantic segmentation. Other works
[4, 36] explore continual learning in 3D settings, though they often depend on large memory
buffers. In contrast, our work introduces a tailored framework for 3D instance segmentation
that effectively transfers knowledge across tasks, even under class imbalance. Long-tailed Recognition.Imbalanced class distributions lead to poor recognition of rare
(long-tail) classes. To address this, re-sampling methods balance the data via input [8, 20, 50,
52, 61] or feature space [3, 14, 40], avoiding naïve under-/over-sampling. Loss re-weighting
offers another direction, using class-based [6, 15, 23, 32, 33, 69] or per-example [45, 55, 62]
adjustments to ensure fair contribution. Parameter regularisation improves generalisation
through weight constraints [2], albeit requiring careful tuning. Other approaches leverage
transfer learning [77, 81], self-supervision [41, 75], or contrastive learning [34, 41, 82] to
improve rare-class representations. Long-tailed recognition is well-studied in 2D with large-
scale datasets [15, 49, 67]; in 3D, ScanNet200 [16, 57] enables similar efforts. Prior 3D
work focused on re-weighting, re-sampling, and transfer learning [57], while regularisation
remains underexplored. CeCo [80] balances class centres via auxiliary loss but overlooks
sampling and augmentation. Lahoud et al. [38] propose adaptive classifier regularisation
for 3D segmentation, outperforming prior approaches without threshold tuning. However,
neither method considers incremental learning. In contrast, we jointly address long-tail and
continual 3D semantic segmentation. 4THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D

Figure 2: Overview ofCLIMB-3Dfor CI-3DIS. The model incrementally learns new classes
across sequential phases. During taskt, point cloudsPand their corresponding labelsY t are
sampled from a combination of the current training datasetD t and Exemplar Replay (ER),
which maintains a small memory of past examples. These are then passed to the current
modelΦ t to produce predicted labelsY t . The Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG) selects the
top-Kpredictions from the previous modelΦ t−1 . These pseudo-labels are then weighted
based on class frequencyf(c)using Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR), and the top-Kre-
weighted labels are selected to form the balanced pseudo-label set ¯Yt . This pseudo-label set
is then concatenated with the ground-truth labels to form a final augmented supervision set
Yt for taskt, which is used to optimise the modelΦ t using Eq. (3). 3 Methodology
3.1 Problem Formulation
3DIS.The objective of this task is to detect and segment each object instance within a point
cloud. Formally, the training dataset is denoted asD={(P i,Yi)}N
i=1, whereNis the number
of training samples. Each inputP i ∈R M×6 is a coloured point cloud consisting ofMpoints,
where each point is represented by its 3D coordinates and RGB values. The corresponding
annotationY i ={(m i,j ,ci,j )}Ji
j=1 containsJ i object instances, wheremi,j ∈ {0,1}M is a binary
mask indicating which points belong to thej-th instance, andc i,j ∈ C={1,...,C}is the
semantic class label of that instance. GivenP i, the modelΦpredicts instance-level outputs
ˆYi ={(ˆmi,j ,ˆci,j )}
ˆJi
j=1, where ˆmi,j and ˆci,j denote the predicted mask and category label for
thej-th instance, respectively. The number of predicted instances ˆJi varies depending on the
model’s inference. The model is optimised using the following objective:

whereL cls andL mask are the average classification and mask losses over all instances, andλ
controls their trade-off. CI-3DIS.Unlike conventional 3DIS, CI-3DIS involves sequential learning, where object
categories are introduced incrementally overTtraining tasks. Each tasktintroduces a dis-
joint set of classesC t , withC= ST

Overview.As shown in Fig. 2 and formulated in Sec. 3.1, the proposed framework for
CI-3DIS follows aphase-wisetraining strategy. In each phase, the model is exposed to a
carefully curated subset of the dataset, simulating real-world scenarios discussed in Sec. 3.3. Training naïvely on such phased data leads tocatastrophic forgetting[51], where the model
forgets prior knowledge when learning new tasks. To address this, we first incorporateEx-
emplar Replay(ER) [5], a strategy inspired by 2D incremental methods [1, 43, 54] and
recently extended to 3D settings [4], to mitigate forgetting by storing a small set of repre-
sentative samples from earlier phases. However, ER alone is insufficient to achieve robust
performance. To address this, two additional components are introduced: aPseudo-Label
Generator(PLG), which leverages a frozen model to generate supervision signals for previ-
ously seen classes, and aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) module that compensates for
class imbalance across phases. Each of these components is described in detail below 1. Exemplar Replay (ER).Inspired by Buzzega et al. [5], ER addresses the issue of catas-
trophic forgetting by allowing the model to retain a subset of data from earlier phases. During phaset, the model is trained not only on the current task dataD t , but also on a
set of exemplarsE 1:t−1, collected from previous phases. These exemplars are accumulated
incrementally:E 1:t−1 =E 1 ∪···∪E t−1 .Here,E t denotes the exemplar subset stored after
phaset, and|E t |denotes the exemplar replay size. The combined replay dataset is denoted
as:D t
ER =D t ∪E 1:t−1.Epoch training consists of two stages: first, the model is trained on
the current data,D t ; then it is trained using exemplars fromE 1:t−1. While previous CI-3DIS approaches rely on large exemplar sets to mitigate forgetting [4],
such strategies become impractical under memory constraints. Consequently, although ER
aids knowledge retention, it is insufficient on its own for robust performance with a limited
exemplar budget. Therefore, PLG and CBR are introduced to better preserve past represen-
tations and enhance generalisation across phases. Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG).In the CI-3DIS setting, during phaset(wheret>1),
although ground-truth labels for previously seen classes are unavailable, the model from the
previous phaseΦ t−1 , which preserves knowledge of past tasks, is retained. We use this
model to generate pseudo-labels for previously seen classes, thereby providing approximate
supervision during training. This allows the current modelΦt , to retain prior knowledge and
reduce forgetting, even without access to ground-truth annotations. Given a point cloud and label pair(P,Y t ), fromD t , the previous modelΦ t−1 , generates
pseudo-labels for the previously seen classes as ˆY1:t−1 =Φ t−1 (P), which we denote as ˜Yt
1For clarity, modifications introduced by each component (ER, PLG, and CBR) are highlighted in green, blue,
and red, respectively. 6THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D
for brevity. However, we observe that utilising all predictions fromΦt−1 introduces noisy or
incorrect labels, which degrade overall performance. To mitigate this, we select the top-K
most confident instance predictions, denoted as ˜Yt
K, and concatenate them with the ground-
truth labels of the current task to obtain the supervision set: ¯Yt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt
K. Following this,
the loss is computed over both the current task’s ground-truth labels and the top-Kconfi-
dent pseudo-labels from earlier phases, enabling the model to retain prior knowledge while
adapting to new classes. Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR).While ER and PLG contribute to preserving prior
knowledge, we observe that the model’s predictions are biased towards frequent classes,
resulting in the forgetting of rare categories. This issue is further amplified by the top-K
pseudo-labels selected by PLG, which predominantly represent dominant classes in the data. To address this, we propose aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) scheme that compensates
for class imbalance using object frequency statistics. At taskt, only the current datasetD t
and its label distributionp t (c)over classesc∈ Ct are available. Datasets and class distribu-
tions from earlier tasks{D i,p i(c)}t−1
i=1 are no longer accessible, which makes it challenging
to directly account for class imbalance across all previously seen tasks. Therefore, we pro-
pose to leverage the pseudo-label predictions of the frozen modelΦ t−1 as a proxy for the
class distribution across previously learned categories. During each training iteration, the previous modelΦ t−1 is applied to the current inputP
to generate pseudo-labels ˜Yt , from which we accumulate class-wise frequency statistics for
previously learned classes. LetC1:t = St
i=1 Ci represent the union of all classes seen up to task
t. At the end of each epoch, we compute the overall class frequencyf∈R |C1:t | by combining
the pseudo-label distribution ˜pt (c)derived from ˜Yt with the ground-truth label distribution
pt (c)from the current task. The resulting frequency vectorf= [f(c)] c∈C1:t is then used to
compute class-wise weightsw= [w(c)] c∈C1:t , which guide balanced pseudo-label selection
and help the model focus on rare classes. In the next epoch, the modelΦ t−1 produces soft pseudo-label predictions ˜Yt (as de-
scribed in PLG) , where each component ˜Yt [c]denotes the confidence score for classc∈
C1:t−1. To promote balanced pseudo-label selection, class-wise re-weighting is applied using
w(c) = 1
f(c)+ε , whereεis a small constant for numerical stability. The adjusted predictions
are computed by applying the class-wise weights as: ˜Yt,w [c] =w(c)· ˜Yt [c],∀c∈ C 1:t−1. Top-Kselection is then applied to both the original and the re-weighted scores, yielding
two pseudo-label sets: ˜Yt
K and ˜Yt,w
K , respectively. The final augmented target set, Yt , is
constructed by concatenating the ground-truth labelsY t with both sets of pseudo-labels:
Yt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt
K ∥ ˜Yt,w
K .(2)
Although the above re-weighting mitigates bias from prior tasks, it does not address class
imbalance within the current taskt. To resolve this, the class-balanced weightsw c are ex-
tended to incorporate statistics from both previously seen and current classes, i.e., overC 1:t
rather than onlyC 1:t−1. The updated weights, denoted asw ′
c, are used to re-weights both
pseudo-label selection and classification loss, ensuring balanced supervision across all seen
categories, including rare ones. This unified strategy reduces bias and enhances performance
across phases. The pseudo-code for constructing the supervision set in Eq. (2), which incor-
porates both PLG and CBR components, is provided in Appendix A. Final Objective.The final training objective ofCLIMB-3D, incorporating ER, PLG, and THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D7

While CI-3DIS methods offer a wide range of practical applications, they frequently rely
on the assumption of uniform sample distribution, which rarely holds in real-world settings. In practice, the number of object categories, denoted byC, is often large and characterised
by substantial variability in category frequency, shape, structure, and size. To address these
challenges, we propose three incremental learning scenarios, each designed to capture a
different facet of real-world complexity. The design of these scenarios is detailed below; for
further information and illustrations, refer to Appendix E of the supplementary material. Split-A: Frequency Scenarios.This scenario acknowledges that datasets are often la-
belled based on the frequency of categories. To accommodate this, we propose a split where
the model learns from the most frequent categories and subsequently incorporates the less
frequent ones in later stages. By prioritising the training of frequently occurring categories,
the model can establish a strong foundation before expanding to handle rare categories. Split-B: Semantic Scenarios.Beyond frequency, semantic similarity is crucial in real-
world deployments. While objects often share visual or functional traits, models may en-
counter semantically different categories in new environments. To simulate this challenge,
we introduce theSplit-Bscenario. Here, categories are grouped based on their semantic
relationships, and the model is incrementally trained on one semantic group at a time. This
setup encourages the model to generalise across semantically similar categories and adapt
more effectively when exposed to new ones. Unlike theSplit-Ascenario, which organises
learning based on category frequency, theSplit-Bscenario may contain both frequent and
infrequent categories within a single task, focusing on semantic continuity and transfer. Split-C: Random Scenarios.In some cases, data labelling is driven by the availability of
objects rather than predefined criteria. To capture this, we introduce theSplit-Cscenario,
which represents a fully random setting where any class can appear in any task, resulting in
varying levels of class imbalance. By exposing the model to such diverse and unpredictable
distributions, we aim to improve its robustness in real-world situations where labelled data
availability is inconsistent. These incremental scenarios are designed to provide a more realistic representation of
object distributions, frequencies, and dynamics encountered in the real world. 4 Experiments

assessing real-world scenarios. In addition, we compare our approach against existing in-
cremental learning methods using ScanNetV2 [16] in the 3DSS setting. For this evaluation,
we follow the standard training and validation splits defined in prior works [74] to ensure
consistency with existing methods. Evaluation Metrics.We evaluate our method usingMean Average Precision(mAP), a
standard metric for 3DIS which provides a comprehensive measure of segmentation quality
by accounting for both precision and recall. For comparison with existing 3DSS methods,
we report themean Intersection over Union(mIoU), which quantifies the overlap between
predicted and ground truth segments. To assess the model’s ability to mitigate catastrophic
forgetting in incremental settings, we use theForgetting Percentage Points(FPP) metric, as
defined in [47]. FPP captures performance degradation by measuring the accuracy drop on
the initially seen categories between the first and final training phases. Detailed descriptions of the incremental scenarios (Split-A,Split-B,Split-C) and im-
plementation are provided in Appendix B. 4.2 Results and Discussion

To evaluate our proposed approach, we construct a baseline using ER [5] for the 3DIS
setting, as no existing incremental baselines are available for this task. In contrast, for the
3DSS setting, where incremental baselines do exist, we compare our method against three
prior approaches [43, 60, 74]. Results on CI-3DIS.Tab. 1 compares CLIMB-3D against the ER baseline across the three
CI-3DIS scenarios, evaluated after all phases using mAP 25, mAP50, overall mAP, and FPP. In theSplit-Ascenario, characterised by significant distribution shifts, our method achieves
gains of +19.23%, +16.76%, and +12.28% in mAP 25, mAP 50, and overall mAP, respec-
tively, while drastically reducing forgetting with FPP scores of 3.44% (mAP 25) and 2.63%
(mAP50), both over 45 points lower than the baseline. Under theSplit-Bscenario, with
semantically related new categories, improvements of +18.26%, +16.49%, and +12.76%
are observed alongside a reduction in forgetting to 8.00% and 5.51% from baseline levels
above 42%. For theSplit-Cscenario, featuring increasing geometric complexity, CLIMB-
3D maintains solid gains of +5.94%, +5.70%, and +4.08% across mAP metrics, with forget-
ting reduced by over 22 points. Overall, these results demonstrate robust forward transfer,
minimal forgetting, and stable learning, highlighting the method’s effectiveness for scalable
continual 3D semantic understanding. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D9

Results on CI-3DSS.Although our primary focus is on CI-3DIS, we also evaluate our
method under the CI-3DSS setting to enable comparisons with existing approaches. To do
so, we adapt our predictions to assign each point the label corresponding to the highest-
confidence mask and exclude background classes (e.g., floor and wall), as these are not part
of the semantic segmentation targets. Tab. 2 presents a comparison between our method and
existing baselines on the ScanNet V2 dataset [16], evaluated using mIoU across two training
phases and overall. Although originally designed for instance segmentation, our method
generalises effectively to semantic segmentation, achieving substantial gains of +35.23%
mIoU in Phase 1 and +19.1% in Phase 2. Overall, it achieves 59.38% mIoU, significantly
higher than the∼30% mIoU of prior methods, highlighting its robustness and transferability. Refer to Appendix C, D, and F of the supplementary material for detailed analyses of per-
phase performance, rare-class evaluation, and qualitative result comparisons, respectively. 4.3 Ablation

We conduct an ablation study to evaluate the contribution of each component in our
framework. As an upper bound, we report the performance of anOraclemodel, which is
trained jointly on the full dataset. For the incremental setting, we follow the previously
defined splits and first train the model naively across phases. We then incrementally add
each module to isolate its impact. Tab. 3 presents results for theSplit-Ascenario using both
mAP50 and FPP metrics. Naïve Training.When trained naïvely without any dedicated modules, the model suffers
from severe catastrophic forgetting, as evident in row 2. The model entirely forgets pre-
viously learned classes upon entering new phases, with performance dropping to zero for
earlier splits and FPP rising to 56.82. 10THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D
Effect of ER.Adding exemplar replay (row 3) partially alleviates forgetting by maintaining
a buffer of past examples. This yields notable gains fors1in Phase 2 (+18.51%) and Phase 3
(+10.38%), and also improvess2in Phase 3 (+9.43%). However, the overall forgetting
remains substantial (FPP: 46.44), showing ER alone is insufficient. Effect of PLG.The addition of the pseudo-label generator (PLG), which generates labels for
previous classes by retaining a copy of the model from an earlier phase, facilitates knowledge
retention and forward transfer. As shown in row 4, PLG significantly reduces forgetting and
enhances performance on current tasks. Fors1, it improves mAP 50 by 31.49% in Phase 2
and 39.40% in Phase 3 over exemplar replay. Overall, PLG yields a 15.00% increase in
performance and reduces forgetting by 39.40%. Effect of CBR.Finally, class-balanced re-weighting (CBR) mitigates class imbalance dur-
ing both pseudo-labelling and current task learning by adjusting each class’s contribution
based on its frequency. As shown in row 5, CBR enhancess1retention over PLG in Phases 2
and 3 (+4.67% and +4.41%), and further improves performance ons2ands3. It also achieves
the lowest FPP of 2.63, reflecting strong forgetting mitigation. Overall, CBR offers the best
trade-off between retaining past knowledge and acquiring new tasks, outperforming PLG
and ER by 4.41% and 43.81%, respectively. 4.4 Limitations & Future Work
While CLIMB-3D achieves strong performance across CI-3DIS and CI-3DSS settings, sev-
eral limitations remain and warrant discussion. The experiments are currently limited to
indoor datasets (ScanNet200 and ScanNetV2), therefore evaluating performance on outdoor
scenes would help assess generalisability across diverse environments. The current setup
also considers only three incremental phases, whereas real-world applications often involve
longer sequences; incorporating such extended setups would better reflect practical chal-
lenges. Moreover, the model operates in a uni-modal setting. Integrating multi-modal cues,
such as vision-language models, could further enhance performance, as suggested by recent
2D and 3D studies [25, 65, 66]. 5 Conclusion
This work addresses the challenge of catastrophic forgetting in class-incremental 3D in-
stance segmentation by introducing a modular framework that integrates exemplar replay
(ER), a pseudo-label generator (PLG), and class-balanced re-weighting (CBR). The pro-
posed method incrementally adapts to new classes while preserving prior knowledge, all
without requiring access to the full dataset. Extensive experiments on a three-phase bench-
mark validate the individual and combined effectiveness of each component: ER enables
efficient memory-based retention; PLG facilitates knowledge preservation through pseudo-
supervision; and CBR mitigates class imbalance to enhance learning stability. Together,
these components significantly reduce forgetting and improve segmentation performance
across all phases. By achieving a strong balance between stability and plasticity, our ap-
proach advances continual 3D scene understanding and sets a new baseline for future re-
search in this area. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D11

5 and Tab. 6, correspond to evaluations onSplit-AforPhase
2andPhase 3, respectively. InPhase 2, we evaluate classes seen 1–20 times per epoch,
whilePhase 3targets even less frequent classes, with observations limited to 1–10 times per
epoch. As illustrated in Tab. 5, the IC module substantially improves performance on rare
classes in terms of mAP 50 in Phase 2 ofSplit-A. For instance, classes likerecycling
binandtrash bin, seen only 3 and 7 times, respectively, shows significant improvement
when the IC module is applied. Overall, the IC module provides an average boost of 8.32%,
highlighting its effectiveness in mitigating class imbalance. Similarly, Tab. 6 presents results forPhase 3, demonstrating significant gains for infre-
quent classes. For example, even though the classes such aspiano,bucket, andlaundry
basketare observed only once, IC module improves the performance by 52.30%, 10.40%,
and 13.60%, respectively. The ER+KD module does not focus on rare classes likeshower
andtoasterwhich results in low performance, but the IC module compensates for this imbal-
ance by focusing on underrepresented categories. On average, the addition of the proposed THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D3

Tab. 7 presents the task splits for each proposed scenario introduced in Section 4.3 using the
ScanNet200 dataset. The three scenarios,Split-A,Split-B, andSplit-C, are each divided
into three tasks: Task 1, Task 2, and Task 3. Notably, the order of classes in these tasks is
random. Appendix E Qualitative Results
In this section, we present a qualitative comparison of the proposed framework with the
baseline method. Fig. 4 illustrates the results on theSplit-Aevaluation after learning all
tasks, comparing the performance of the baseline method and our proposed approach. As
shown in the figure, our method demonstrates superior instance segmentation performance
compared to the baseline. For example, in row 1, the baseline method fails to segment
thesink, while in row 3, thesofainstance is missed. Overall, our framework consistently
outperforms the baseline, with several missed instances by the baseline highlighted in red 4THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D

on individual splits across various scenarios. The results clearly demonstrate that our model
consistently retains knowledge of previous tasks better than the baseline. ForSplit-A, our
model shows improvement throughout the phase. In Phase 3 of (s2), although both the base-
line and our method exhibit a performance drop, our method reduces forgetting significantly
compared to the baseline. TheSplit-Bscenario, while more complex thanSplit-A, achieves
comparable results due to semantic similarity among classes within the same task. In Phase

trend is observed in Phase 3, where our method not only consistently improves learning but
also enhances retention of previous information. After all three tasks, our method achieves
an overall performance of 31.56% AP50, compared to 15.07% for the baseline. In theSplit-
Cscenario, the first-stage model struggles due to the increased complexity introduced by
random grouping. In Phase 2, while the baseline focuses on learning the current task, it suf-

on individual splits across various scenarios. The results clearly demonstrate that our model
consistently retains knowledge of previous tasks better than the baseline. ForSplit-A, our
model shows improvement throughout the phase. In Phase 3 of (s2), although both the base-
line and our method exhibit a performance drop, our method reduces forgetting significantly
compared to the baseline. TheSplit-Bscenario, while more complex thanSplit-A, achieves
comparable results due to semantic similarity among classes within the same task. In Phase
2, our model achieves overall all 43.13% mAP50 compared to 24.53% on baseline, a similar
trend is observed in Phase 3, where our method not only consistently improves learning but
also enhances retention of previous information. After all three tasks, our method achieves
an overall performance of 31.56% AP50, compared to 15.07% for the baseline. In theSplit-
Cscenario, the first-stage model struggles due to the increased complexity introduced by
random grouping. In Phase 2, while the baseline focuses on learning the current task, it suf-

mance with the framework which has exemplar replay (ER) and knowledge distillation (KD). Specifically, we focus on its ability to improve performance for rare classes, which the model

2andPhase 3, respectively. InPhase 2, we evaluate classes seen 1–20 times per epoch,
whilePhase 3targets even less frequent classes, with observations limited to 1–10 times per
epoch. As illustrated in Tab. 5, the IC module substantially improves performance on rare
classes in terms of mAP 50 in Phase 2 ofSplit-A. For instance, classes likerecycling

when the IC module is applied. Overall, the IC module provides an average boost of 8.32%,
highlighting its effectiveness in mitigating class imbalance. Similarly, Tab. 6 presents results forPhase 3, demonstrating significant gains for infre-

1 Introduction
Table Chair Couch Pillow Coffee Table Sofa Chair Recycling BinCabinet Unknown
Task-1 Task-2 Task-3
Figure 1:Overview of the CI-3DIS setting.New object categories are introduced incre-
mentally with each task. After every phase, the model must recognise both newly added
and previously learned classes. For instance, in Task 2, categories such asPillow,Coffee
Table, andSofa Chairare introduced, while the model is expected to retain recognition
of earlier classes likeTable,Chair, andCouch. 3D instance segmentation (3DIS) is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves
identifying precise object boundaries and class labels in 3D space, with broad applications in
graphics, robotics, and augmented reality [4, 39]. Traditional 3DIS methods, including top-
down [28, 70, 78], bottom-up [26, 73], and transformer-based approaches [59], perform well
under the assumption that all classes are available and balanced during training. However,
this assumption does not hold in real-world environments, where new object classes emerge
over time and exhibit natural imbalance. This gap motivates the need for Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) [17, 54], which sup-
ports learning new categories while retaining knowledge of previous ones [51]. While CIL
has seen success in 2D image tasks [1, 43, 54, 60], extensions to 3D point clouds remain
limited, often focusing on object-level classification [13, 18, 48]. Recent works on scene-
level class-incremental 3DIS (CI-3DIS) [4] and class-incremental semantic segmentation
(CI-3DSS) [74] show promise, but depend heavily on large exemplar [56] and overlook class
imbalance, limiting their practicality. To address this, we proposeCLIMB-3D, a unified framework forCLass-incremental
IMBalance-aware3DIS that jointly tackles catastrophic forgetting and class imbalance. The
framework begins with Exemplar Replay (ER), storing a small number of samples from
past classes for later replay. However, this alone does not yield promising results under the
strict memory constraints required in CI-3DIS. To address this, we introduce a Pseudo-Label
Generator (PLG), which uses a frozen model from previous task to generate supervision for
earlier classes. However, we observed that PLG tends to favour frequent classes while ig-
noring under-represented ones. To mitigate this, we propose a Class-Balanced Re-weighting
(CBR), which estimates class frequencies from the pseudo-labels to enhance the learning of
rare classes without accessing past data. Together, these components form a practical and
effective solution for real-world 3DIS. To evaluate CLIMB-3D, we designed three benchmark scenarios for CI-3DIS based on
the ScanNet200 dataset [57]. These scenarios simulate incremental learning setup under nat-
ural class imbalance, where new classes emerge based on (A) object frequency, (B) semantic
similarity, or (C) random grouping. Additionally, for comparison with existing methods,
we evaluate our approach on CI-3DSS using the ScanNetV2 dataset [16]. Experimental re-
sults show that our method significantly reduces forgetting and improves performance across
both frequent and rare categories, outperforming previous methods in both settings. Fig. 1
illustrates the CI-3DIS setup. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D3
In summary, our contributions are: (i) a novel problem setting of imbalanced class-
incremental 3DIS with an effective method to balance learning and mitigate forgetting; (ii)
three benchmarks modelling continual object emergence with natural imbalance; and (iii)
strong experimental results, achieving up to 16.76% mAP improvement over baselines. 2 Related Work
3D Instance Segmentation.Various methods have been proposed for 3DIS. Grouping-
based approaches adopt a bottom-up pipeline that learns latent embeddings for point cluster-
ing [9, 21, 22, 29, 37, 44, 70, 78]. In contrast, proposal-based methods follow a top-down
strategy by detecting 3D boxes and segmenting objects within them [19, 26, 46, 73, 76]. Recently, transformer-based models [68] have also been applied to 3DIS and 3DSS [59, 64],
inspired by advances in 2D vision [10, 11]. However, these approaches require full anno-
tations for all classes and are not designed for progressive learning, where only new class
annotations are available and previous data is inaccessible. Another line of work aims to re-
duce annotation costs by proposing weakly supervised 3DIS methods based on sparse cues
[12, 27, 72]. While effective with limited annotations, these methods assume a fixed set of
classes and are susceptible to catastrophic forgetting in incremental settings. Incremental Learning.Continual learning involves training models sequentially to miti-
gate catastrophic forgetting. One common strategy is model regularisation, which constrains
parameter updates using techniques such as elastic weight consolidation or knowledge dis-
tillation [1, 24, 35, 43, 60]. Another approach is exemplar replay, where past data is stored
or generated to rehearse older tasks while learning new ones [5, 7, 30, 54]. A third direc-
tion involves dynamically expanding the model architecture or using modular sub-networks
to accommodate new tasks without interfering with old ones [31, 42, 53, 58, 71, 79]. Re-
cent efforts in class-incremental 3D segmentation [63, 74] have shown early promise but
often rely on basic architectures and focus primarily on semantic segmentation. Other works
[4, 36] explore continual learning in 3D settings, though they often depend on large memory
buffers. In contrast, our work introduces a tailored framework for 3D instance segmentation
that effectively transfers knowledge across tasks, even under class imbalance. Long-tailed Recognition.Imbalanced class distributions lead to poor recognition of rare
(long-tail) classes. To address this, re-sampling methods balance the data via input [8, 20, 50,
52, 61] or feature space [3, 14, 40], avoiding naïve under-/over-sampling. Loss re-weighting
offers another direction, using class-based [6, 15, 23, 32, 33, 69] or per-example [45, 55, 62]
adjustments to ensure fair contribution. Parameter regularisation improves generalisation
through weight constraints [2], albeit requiring careful tuning. Other approaches leverage
transfer learning [77, 81], self-supervision [41, 75], or contrastive learning [34, 41, 82] to
improve rare-class representations. Long-tailed recognition is well-studied in 2D with large-
scale datasets [15, 49, 67]; in 3D, ScanNet200 [16, 57] enables similar efforts. Prior 3D
work focused on re-weighting, re-sampling, and transfer learning [57], while regularisation
remains underexplored. CeCo [80] balances class centres via auxiliary loss but overlooks
sampling and augmentation. Lahoud et al. [38] propose adaptive classifier regularisation
for 3D segmentation, outperforming prior approaches without threshold tuning. However,
neither method considers incremental learning. In contrast, we jointly address long-tail and
continual 3D semantic segmentation. 4THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D

Figure 2: Overview ofCLIMB-3Dfor CI-3DIS. The model incrementally learns new classes
across sequential phases. During taskt, point cloudsPand their corresponding labelsY t are
sampled from a combination of the current training datasetD t and Exemplar Replay (ER),
which maintains a small memory of past examples. These are then passed to the current
modelΦ t to produce predicted labelsY t . The Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG) selects the
top-Kpredictions from the previous modelΦ t−1 . These pseudo-labels are then weighted
based on class frequencyf(c)using Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR), and the top-Kre-
weighted labels are selected to form the balanced pseudo-label set ¯Yt . This pseudo-label set
is then concatenated with the ground-truth labels to form a final augmented supervision set
Yt for taskt, which is used to optimise the modelΦ t using Eq. (3). 3 Methodology
3.1 Problem Formulation
3DIS.The objective of this task is to detect and segment each object instance within a point
cloud. Formally, the training dataset is denoted asD={(P i,Yi)}N
i=1, whereNis the number
of training samples. Each inputP i ∈R M×6 is a coloured point cloud consisting ofMpoints,
where each point is represented by its 3D coordinates and RGB values. The corresponding
annotationY i ={(m i,j ,ci,j )}Ji
j=1 containsJ i object instances, wheremi,j ∈ {0,1}M is a binary
mask indicating which points belong to thej-th instance, andc i,j ∈ C={1,...,C}is the
semantic class label of that instance. GivenP i, the modelΦpredicts instance-level outputs
ˆYi ={(ˆmi,j ,ˆci,j )}
ˆJi
j=1, where ˆmi,j and ˆci,j denote the predicted mask and category label for
thej-th instance, respectively. The number of predicted instances ˆJi varies depending on the
model’s inference. The model is optimised using the following objective:
L3DIS(D;Φ) = 1

whereL cls andL mask are the average classification and mask losses over all instances, andλ
controls their trade-off. CI-3DIS.Unlike conventional 3DIS, CI-3DIS involves sequential learning, where object
categories are introduced incrementally overTtraining tasks. Each tasktintroduces a dis-
joint set of classesC t , withC= ST

encountered in previous tasks, despite limited supervision and the absence of past labels. 3.2 Method: CLIMB-3D
Overview.As shown in Fig. 2 and formulated in Sec. 3.1, the proposed framework for
CI-3DIS follows aphase-wisetraining strategy. In each phase, the model is exposed to a
carefully curated subset of the dataset, simulating real-world scenarios discussed in Sec. 3.3. Training naïvely on such phased data leads tocatastrophic forgetting[51], where the model
forgets prior knowledge when learning new tasks. To address this, we first incorporateEx-
emplar Replay(ER) [5], a strategy inspired by 2D incremental methods [1, 43, 54] and
recently extended to 3D settings [4], to mitigate forgetting by storing a small set of repre-
sentative samples from earlier phases. However, ER alone is insufficient to achieve robust
performance. To address this, two additional components are introduced: aPseudo-Label
Generator(PLG), which leverages a frozen model to generate supervision signals for previ-
ously seen classes, and aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) module that compensates for
class imbalance across phases. Each of these components is described in detail below 1. Exemplar Replay (ER).Inspired by Buzzega et al. [5], ER addresses the issue of catas-
trophic forgetting by allowing the model to retain a subset of data from earlier phases. During phaset, the model is trained not only on the current task dataD t , but also on a
set of exemplarsE 1:t−1, collected from previous phases. These exemplars are accumulated
incrementally:E 1:t−1 =E 1 ∪···∪E t−1 .Here,E t denotes the exemplar subset stored after
phaset, and|E t |denotes the exemplar replay size. The combined replay dataset is denoted
as:D t
ER =D t ∪E 1:t−1.Epoch training consists of two stages: first, the model is trained on
the current data,D t ; then it is trained using exemplars fromE 1:t−1. While previous CI-3DIS approaches rely on large exemplar sets to mitigate forgetting [4],
such strategies become impractical under memory constraints. Consequently, although ER
aids knowledge retention, it is insufficient on its own for robust performance with a limited
exemplar budget. Therefore, PLG and CBR are introduced to better preserve past represen-
tations and enhance generalisation across phases. Pseudo-Label Generator (PLG).In the CI-3DIS setting, during phaset(wheret>1),
although ground-truth labels for previously seen classes are unavailable, the model from the
previous phaseΦ t−1 , which preserves knowledge of past tasks, is retained. We use this
model to generate pseudo-labels for previously seen classes, thereby providing approximate
supervision during training. This allows the current modelΦt , to retain prior knowledge and
reduce forgetting, even without access to ground-truth annotations. Given a point cloud and label pair(P,Y t ), fromD t , the previous modelΦ t−1 , generates
pseudo-labels for the previously seen classes as ˆY1:t−1 =Φ t−1 (P), which we denote as ˜Yt
1For clarity, modifications introduced by each component (ER, PLG, and CBR) are highlighted in green, blue,
and red, respectively. 6THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D
for brevity. However, we observe that utilising all predictions fromΦt−1 introduces noisy or
incorrect labels, which degrade overall performance. To mitigate this, we select the top-K
most confident instance predictions, denoted as ˜Yt
K, and concatenate them with the ground-
truth labels of the current task to obtain the supervision set: ¯Yt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt
K. Following this,
the loss is computed over both the current task’s ground-truth labels and the top-Kconfi-
dent pseudo-labels from earlier phases, enabling the model to retain prior knowledge while
adapting to new classes. Class-Balanced Re-weighting (CBR).While ER and PLG contribute to preserving prior
knowledge, we observe that the model’s predictions are biased towards frequent classes,
resulting in the forgetting of rare categories. This issue is further amplified by the top-K
pseudo-labels selected by PLG, which predominantly represent dominant classes in the data. To address this, we propose aClass-Balanced Re-weighting(CBR) scheme that compensates
for class imbalance using object frequency statistics. At taskt, only the current datasetD t
and its label distributionp t (c)over classesc∈ Ct are available. Datasets and class distribu-
tions from earlier tasks{D i,p i(c)}t−1
i=1 are no longer accessible, which makes it challenging
to directly account for class imbalance across all previously seen tasks. Therefore, we pro-
pose to leverage the pseudo-label predictions of the frozen modelΦ t−1 as a proxy for the
class distribution across previously learned categories. During each training iteration, the previous modelΦ t−1 is applied to the current inputP
to generate pseudo-labels ˜Yt , from which we accumulate class-wise frequency statistics for
previously learned classes. LetC1:t = St
i=1 Ci represent the union of all classes seen up to task
t. At the end of each epoch, we compute the overall class frequencyf∈R |C1:t | by combining
the pseudo-label distribution ˜pt (c)derived from ˜Yt with the ground-truth label distribution
pt (c)from the current task. The resulting frequency vectorf= [f(c)] c∈C1:t is then used to
compute class-wise weightsw= [w(c)] c∈C1:t , which guide balanced pseudo-label selection
and help the model focus on rare classes. In the next epoch, the modelΦ t−1 produces soft pseudo-label predictions ˜Yt (as de-
scribed in PLG) , where each component ˜Yt [c]denotes the confidence score for classc∈
C1:t−1. To promote balanced pseudo-label selection, class-wise re-weighting is applied using
w(c) = 1
f(c)+ε , whereεis a small constant for numerical stability. The adjusted predictions
are computed by applying the class-wise weights as: ˜Yt,w [c] =w(c)· ˜Yt [c],∀c∈ C 1:t−1. Top-Kselection is then applied to both the original and the re-weighted scores, yielding
two pseudo-label sets: ˜Yt
K and ˜Yt,w
K , respectively. The final augmented target set, Yt , is
constructed by concatenating the ground-truth labelsY t with both sets of pseudo-labels:
Yt =Y t ∥ ˜Yt
K ∥ ˜Yt,w
K .(2)
Although the above re-weighting mitigates bias from prior tasks, it does not address class
imbalance within the current taskt. To resolve this, the class-balanced weightsw c are ex-
tended to incorporate statistics from both previously seen and current classes, i.e., overC 1:t
rather than onlyC 1:t−1. The updated weights, denoted asw ′
c, are used to re-weights both
pseudo-label selection and classification loss, ensuring balanced supervision across all seen
categories, including rare ones. This unified strategy reduces bias and enhances performance
across phases. The pseudo-code for constructing the supervision set in Eq. (2), which incor-
porates both PLG and CBR components, is provided in Appendix A. Final Objective.The final training objective ofCLIMB-3D, incorporating ER, PLG, and THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D7
CBR, is formulated in Eq. (1) as:

While CI-3DIS methods offer a wide range of practical applications, they frequently rely
on the assumption of uniform sample distribution, which rarely holds in real-world settings. In practice, the number of object categories, denoted byC, is often large and characterised
by substantial variability in category frequency, shape, structure, and size. To address these
challenges, we propose three incremental learning scenarios, each designed to capture a
different facet of real-world complexity. The design of these scenarios is detailed below; for
further information and illustrations, refer to Appendix E of the supplementary material. Split-A: Frequency Scenarios.This scenario acknowledges that datasets are often la-
belled based on the frequency of categories. To accommodate this, we propose a split where
the model learns from the most frequent categories and subsequently incorporates the less
frequent ones in later stages. By prioritising the training of frequently occurring categories,
the model can establish a strong foundation before expanding to handle rare categories. Split-B: Semantic Scenarios.Beyond frequency, semantic similarity is crucial in real-
world deployments. While objects often share visual or functional traits, models may en-
counter semantically different categories in new environments. To simulate this challenge,
we introduce theSplit-Bscenario. Here, categories are grouped based on their semantic
relationships, and the model is incrementally trained on one semantic group at a time. This
setup encourages the model to generalise across semantically similar categories and adapt
more effectively when exposed to new ones. Unlike theSplit-Ascenario, which organises
learning based on category frequency, theSplit-Bscenario may contain both frequent and
infrequent categories within a single task, focusing on semantic continuity and transfer. Split-C: Random Scenarios.In some cases, data labelling is driven by the availability of
objects rather than predefined criteria. To capture this, we introduce theSplit-Cscenario,
which represents a fully random setting where any class can appear in any task, resulting in
varying levels of class imbalance. By exposing the model to such diverse and unpredictable
distributions, we aim to improve its robustness in real-world situations where labelled data
availability is inconsistent. These incremental scenarios are designed to provide a more realistic representation of
object distributions, frequencies, and dynamics encountered in the real world. 4 Experiments

assessing real-world scenarios. In addition, we compare our approach against existing in-
cremental learning methods using ScanNetV2 [16] in the 3DSS setting. For this evaluation,
we follow the standard training and validation splits defined in prior works [74] to ensure
consistency with existing methods. Evaluation Metrics.We evaluate our method usingMean Average Precision(mAP), a
standard metric for 3DIS which provides a comprehensive measure of segmentation quality
by accounting for both precision and recall. For comparison with existing 3DSS methods,
we report themean Intersection over Union(mIoU), which quantifies the overlap between
predicted and ground truth segments. To assess the model’s ability to mitigate catastrophic
forgetting in incremental settings, we use theForgetting Percentage Points(FPP) metric, as
defined in [47]. FPP captures performance degradation by measuring the accuracy drop on
the initially seen categories between the first and final training phases. Detailed descriptions of the incremental scenarios (Split-A,Split-B,Split-C) and im-
plementation are provided in Appendix B. 4.2 Results and Discussion

To evaluate our proposed approach, we construct a baseline using ER [5] for the 3DIS
setting, as no existing incremental baselines are available for this task. In contrast, for the
3DSS setting, where incremental baselines do exist, we compare our method against three
prior approaches [43, 60, 74]. Results on CI-3DIS.Tab. 1 compares CLIMB-3D against the ER baseline across the three
CI-3DIS scenarios, evaluated after all phases using mAP 25, mAP50, overall mAP, and FPP. In theSplit-Ascenario, characterised by significant distribution shifts, our method achieves
gains of +19.23%, +16.76%, and +12.28% in mAP 25, mAP 50, and overall mAP, respec-
tively, while drastically reducing forgetting with FPP scores of 3.44% (mAP 25) and 2.63%
(mAP50), both over 45 points lower than the baseline. Under theSplit-Bscenario, with
semantically related new categories, improvements of +18.26%, +16.49%, and +12.76%
are observed alongside a reduction in forgetting to 8.00% and 5.51% from baseline levels
above 42%. For theSplit-Cscenario, featuring increasing geometric complexity, CLIMB-
3D maintains solid gains of +5.94%, +5.70%, and +4.08% across mAP metrics, with forget-
ting reduced by over 22 points. Overall, these results demonstrate robust forward transfer,
minimal forgetting, and stable learning, highlighting the method’s effectiveness for scalable
continual 3D semantic understanding. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D9

Results on CI-3DSS.Although our primary focus is on CI-3DIS, we also evaluate our
method under the CI-3DSS setting to enable comparisons with existing approaches. To do
so, we adapt our predictions to assign each point the label corresponding to the highest-
confidence mask and exclude background classes (e.g., floor and wall), as these are not part
of the semantic segmentation targets. Tab. 2 presents a comparison between our method and
existing baselines on the ScanNet V2 dataset [16], evaluated using mIoU across two training
phases and overall. Although originally designed for instance segmentation, our method
generalises effectively to semantic segmentation, achieving substantial gains of +35.23%
mIoU in Phase 1 and +19.1% in Phase 2. Overall, it achieves 59.38% mIoU, significantly
higher than the∼30% mIoU of prior methods, highlighting its robustness and transferability. Refer to Appendix C, D, and F of the supplementary material for detailed analyses of per-
phase performance, rare-class evaluation, and qualitative result comparisons, respectively. 4.3 Ablation

We conduct an ablation study to evaluate the contribution of each component in our
framework. As an upper bound, we report the performance of anOraclemodel, which is
trained jointly on the full dataset. For the incremental setting, we follow the previously
defined splits and first train the model naively across phases. We then incrementally add
each module to isolate its impact. Tab. 3 presents results for theSplit-Ascenario using both
mAP50 and FPP metrics. Naïve Training.When trained naïvely without any dedicated modules, the model suffers
from severe catastrophic forgetting, as evident in row 2. The model entirely forgets pre-
viously learned classes upon entering new phases, with performance dropping to zero for
earlier splits and FPP rising to 56.82. 10THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D
Effect of ER.Adding exemplar replay (row 3) partially alleviates forgetting by maintaining
a buffer of past examples. This yields notable gains fors1in Phase 2 (+18.51%) and Phase 3
(+10.38%), and also improvess2in Phase 3 (+9.43%). However, the overall forgetting
remains substantial (FPP: 46.44), showing ER alone is insufficient. Effect of PLG.The addition of the pseudo-label generator (PLG), which generates labels for
previous classes by retaining a copy of the model from an earlier phase, facilitates knowledge
retention and forward transfer. As shown in row 4, PLG significantly reduces forgetting and
enhances performance on current tasks. Fors1, it improves mAP 50 by 31.49% in Phase 2
and 39.40% in Phase 3 over exemplar replay. Overall, PLG yields a 15.00% increase in
performance and reduces forgetting by 39.40%. Effect of CBR.Finally, class-balanced re-weighting (CBR) mitigates class imbalance dur-
ing both pseudo-labelling and current task learning by adjusting each class’s contribution
based on its frequency. As shown in row 5, CBR enhancess1retention over PLG in Phases 2
and 3 (+4.67% and +4.41%), and further improves performance ons2ands3. It also achieves
the lowest FPP of 2.63, reflecting strong forgetting mitigation. Overall, CBR offers the best
trade-off between retaining past knowledge and acquiring new tasks, outperforming PLG
and ER by 4.41% and 43.81%, respectively. 4.4 Limitations & Future Work
While CLIMB-3D achieves strong performance across CI-3DIS and CI-3DSS settings, sev-
eral limitations remain and warrant discussion. The experiments are currently limited to
indoor datasets (ScanNet200 and ScanNetV2), therefore evaluating performance on outdoor
scenes would help assess generalisability across diverse environments. The current setup
also considers only three incremental phases, whereas real-world applications often involve
longer sequences; incorporating such extended setups would better reflect practical chal-
lenges. Moreover, the model operates in a uni-modal setting. Integrating multi-modal cues,
such as vision-language models, could further enhance performance, as suggested by recent
2D and 3D studies [25, 65, 66]. 5 Conclusion
This work addresses the challenge of catastrophic forgetting in class-incremental 3D in-
stance segmentation by introducing a modular framework that integrates exemplar replay
(ER), a pseudo-label generator (PLG), and class-balanced re-weighting (CBR). The pro-
posed method incrementally adapts to new classes while preserving prior knowledge, all
without requiring access to the full dataset. Extensive experiments on a three-phase bench-
mark validate the individual and combined effectiveness of each component: ER enables
efficient memory-based retention; PLG facilitates knowledge preservation through pseudo-
supervision; and CBR mitigates class imbalance to enhance learning stability. Together,
these components significantly reduce forgetting and improve segmentation performance
across all phases. By achieving a strong balance between stability and plasticity, our ap-
proach advances continual 3D scene understanding and sets a new baseline for future re-
search in this area. THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D11

1 to Tab. 4 to highlight the impact of our proposed method
on individual splits across various scenarios. The results clearly demonstrate that our model
consistently retains knowledge of previous tasks better than the baseline. ForSplit-A, our
model shows improvement throughout the phase. In Phase 3 of (s2), although both the base-
line and our method exhibit a performance drop, our method reduces forgetting significantly
compared to the baseline. TheSplit-Bscenario, while more complex thanSplit-A, achieves
comparable results due to semantic similarity among classes within the same task. In Phase
2, our model achieves overall all 43.13% mAP50 compared to 24.53% on baseline, a similar
trend is observed in Phase 3, where our method not only consistently improves learning but
also enhances retention of previous information. After all three tasks, our method achieves
an overall performance of 31.56% AP50, compared to 15.07% for the baseline. In theSplit-
Cscenario, the first-stage model struggles due to the increased complexity introduced by
random grouping. In Phase 2, while the baseline focuses on learning the current task, it suf-
fers from severe forgetting of prior knowledge. Conversely, our method balances new task
learning with the retention of earlier information. By Phase 3, the model effectively con- 2THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D

The proposed imbalance correction (IC) module, as detailed in Section 4.2, is designed to
address the performance gap for rare classes. To assess its impact, we compare its perfor-
mance with the framework which has exemplar replay (ER) and knowledge distillation (KD). Specifically, we focus on its ability to improve performance for rare classes, which the model
encounters infrequently compared to more common classes. The results, shown in Tab."

whilePhase 3targets even less frequent classes, with observations limited to 1–10 times per

classes in terms of mAP 50 in Phase 2 ofSplit-A. For instance, classes likerecycling

highlighting its effectiveness in mitigating class imbalance. Similarly, Tab. 6 presents results forPhase 3, demonstrating significant gains for infre-
quent classes. For example, even though the classes such aspiano,bucket, andlaundry
basketare observed only once, IC module improves the performance by 52.30%, 10.40%,
and 13.60%, respectively. The ER+KD module does not focus on rare classes likeshower

ance by focusing on underrepresented categories. On average, the addition of the proposed THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D3

Tab. 7 presents the task splits for each proposed scenario introduced in Section 4.3 using the
ScanNet200 dataset. The three scenarios,Split-A,Split-B, andSplit-C, are each divided
into three tasks: Task 1, Task 2, and Task 3. Notably, the order of classes in these tasks is
random. Appendix E Qualitative Results
In this section, we present a qualitative comparison of the proposed framework with the
baseline method. Fig. 4 illustrates the results on theSplit-Aevaluation after learning all
tasks, comparing the performance of the baseline method and our proposed approach. As
shown in the figure, our method demonstrates superior instance segmentation performance
compared to the baseline. For example, in row 1, the baseline method fails to segment
thesink, while in row 3, thesofainstance is missed. Overall, our framework consistently
outperforms the baseline, with several missed instances by the baseline highlighted in red 4THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D

The proposed imbalance correction (IC) module, as detailed in Section 4.2, is designed to
address the performance gap for rare classes. To assess its impact, we compare its perfor-
mance with the framework which has exemplar replay (ER) and knowledge distillation (KD). Specifically, we focus on its ability to improve performance for rare classes, which the model
encounters infrequently compared to more common classes. The results, shown in Tab.

whilePhase 3targets even less frequent classes, with observations limited to 1–10 times per
epoch. As illustrated in Tab. 5, the IC module substantially improves performance on rare
classes in terms of mAP 50 in Phase 2 ofSplit-A. For instance, classes likerecycling

when the IC module is applied. Overall, the IC module provides an average boost of 8.32%,

method improves mAP by 5.6%. In this supplementary material, we first demonstrate the performance gains on rare classes
achieved by incorporating the IC module in Appendix C. Next, we provide detailed split in-
formation for all scenarios, based on class names, in Appendix D. Finally, we present a qual-
itative comparison between the baseline method and our proposed approach in Appendix
E. Appendix C Evaluation on Rare Categories
The proposed imbalance correction (IC) module, as detailed in Section 4.2, is designed to
address the performance gap for rare classes. To assess its impact, we compare its perfor-
mance with the framework which has exemplar replay (ER) and knowledge distillation (KD). Specifically, we focus on its ability to improve performance for rare classes, which the model
encounters infrequently compared to more common classes. The results, shown in Tab.

5 and Tab. 6, correspond to evaluations onSplit-AforPhase
2andPhase 3, respectively. InPhase 2, we evaluate classes seen 1–20 times per epoch,
whilePhase 3targets even less frequent classes, with observations limited to 1–10 times per
epoch. As illustrated in Tab. 5, the IC module substantially improves performance on rare
classes in terms of mAP 50 in Phase 2 ofSplit-A. For instance, classes likerecycling
binandtrash bin, seen only 3 and 7 times, respectively, shows significant improvement
when the IC module is applied. Overall, the IC module provides an average boost of 8.32%,
highlighting its effectiveness in mitigating class imbalance. Similarly, Tab. 6 presents results forPhase 3, demonstrating significant gains for infre-
quent classes. For example, even though the classes such aspiano,bucket, andlaundry
basketare observed only once, IC module improves the performance by 52.30%, 10.40%,
and 13.60%, respectively. The ER+KD module does not focus on rare classes likeshower
andtoasterwhich results in low performance, but the IC module compensates for this imbal-
ance by focusing on underrepresented categories. On average, the addition of the proposed THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D3

Tab. 7 presents the task splits for each proposed scenario introduced in Section 4.3 using the
ScanNet200 dataset. The three scenarios,Split-A,Split-B, andSplit-C, are each divided
into three tasks: Task 1, Task 2, and Task 3. Notably, the order of classes in these tasks is
random. Appendix E Qualitative Results
In this section, we present a qualitative comparison of the proposed framework with the
baseline method. Fig. 4 illustrates the results on theSplit-Aevaluation after learning all
tasks, comparing the performance of the baseline method and our proposed approach. As
shown in the figure, our method demonstrates superior instance segmentation performance
compared to the baseline. For example, in row 1, the baseline method fails to segment
thesink, while in row 3, thesofainstance is missed. Overall, our framework consistently
outperforms the baseline, with several missed instances by the baseline highlighted in red 4THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D

1 to Tab. 4 to highlight the impact of our proposed method
on individual splits across various scenarios. The results clearly demonstrate that our model
consistently retains knowledge of previous tasks better than the baseline. ForSplit-A, our
model shows improvement throughout the phase. In Phase 3 of (s2), although both the base-
line and our method exhibit a performance drop, our method reduces forgetting significantly
compared to the baseline. TheSplit-Bscenario, while more complex thanSplit-A, achieves
comparable results due to semantic similarity among classes within the same task. In Phase
2, our model achieves overall all 43.13% mAP50 compared to 24.53% on baseline, a similar
trend is observed in Phase 3, where our method not only consistently improves learning but
also enhances retention of previous information. After all three tasks, our method achieves
an overall performance of 31.56% AP50, compared to 15.07% for the baseline. In theSplit-
Cscenario, the first-stage model struggles due to the increased complexity introduced by
random grouping. In Phase 2, while the baseline focuses on learning the current task, it suf-
fers from severe forgetting of prior knowledge. Conversely, our method balances new task
learning with the retention of earlier information. By Phase 3, the model effectively con- 2THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D

Tab. 7 presents the task splits for each proposed scenario introduced in Section 4.3 using the
ScanNet200 dataset. The three scenarios,Split-A,Split-B, andSplit-C, are each divided
into three tasks: Task 1, Task 2, and Task 3. Notably, the order of classes in these tasks is
random. Appendix E Qualitative Results
In this section, we present a qualitative comparison of the proposed framework with the
baseline method. Fig. 4 illustrates the results on theSplit-Aevaluation after learning all
tasks, comparing the performance of the baseline method and our proposed approach. As
shown in the figure, our method demonstrates superior instance segmentation performance
compared to the baseline. For example, in row 1, the baseline method fails to segment
thesink, while in row 3, thesofainstance is missed. Overall, our framework consistently
outperforms the baseline, with several missed instances by the baseline highlighted in red 4THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D

We extend the analysis from Tab.

The three scenariosSplit-A,Split-A, andSplit-Care each divided into three tasks: Task 1, Task 2, and Task 3.

1 to Tab. 4 to highlight the impact of our proposed method
on individual splits across various scenarios. The results clearly demonstrate that our model
consistently retains knowledge of previous tasks better than the baseline. ForSplit-A, our
model shows improvement throughout the phase. In Phase 3 of (s2), although both the base-
line and our method exhibit a performance drop, our method reduces forgetting significantly
compared to the baseline. TheSplit-Bscenario, while more complex thanSplit-A, achieves
comparable results due to semantic similarity among classes within the same task. In Phase
2, our model achieves overall all 43.13% mAP50 compared to 24.53% on baseline, a similar
trend is observed in Phase 3, where our method not only consistently improves learning but
also enhances retention of previous information. After all three tasks, our method achieves
an overall performance of 31.56% AP50, compared to 15.07% for the baseline. In theSplit-
Cscenario, the first-stage model struggles due to the increased complexity introduced by
random grouping. In Phase 2, while the baseline focuses on learning the current task, it suf-
fers from severe forgetting of prior knowledge. Conversely, our method balances new task
learning with the retention of earlier information. By Phase 3, the model effectively con- 2THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D

address the performance gap for rare classes. To assess its impact, we compare its perfor-

encounters infrequently compared to more common classes. The results, shown in Tab."

whilePhase 3targets even less frequent classes, with observations limited to 1–10 times per

classes in terms of mAP 50 in Phase 2 ofSplit-A. For instance, classes likerecycling

when the IC module is applied. Overall, the IC module provides an average boost of 8.32%,
highlighting its effectiveness in mitigating class imbalance. Similarly, Tab. 6 presents results forPhase 3, demonstrating significant gains for infre-

In this section, we present a qualitative comparison of the proposed framework with the
baseline method. Fig. 4 illustrates the results on theSplit-Aevaluation after learning all
tasks, comparing the performance of the baseline method and our proposed approach. As
shown in the figure, our method demonstrates superior instance segmentation performance
compared to the baseline. For example, in row 1, the baseline method fails to segment

outperforms the baseline, with several missed instances by the baseline highlighted in red 4THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D

1 to Tab. 4 to highlight the impact of our proposed method
on individual splits across various scenarios. The results clearly demonstrate that our model
consistently retains knowledge of previous tasks better than the baseline. ForSplit-A, our
model shows improvement throughout the phase. In Phase 3 of (s2), although both the base-
line and our method exhibit a performance drop, our method reduces forgetting significantly
compared to the baseline. TheSplit-Bscenario, while more complex thanSplit-A, achieves
comparable results due to semantic similarity among classes within the same task. In Phase
2, our model achieves overall all 43.13% mAP50 compared to 24.53% on baseline, a similar
trend is observed in Phase 3, where our method not only consistently improves learning but
also enhances retention of previous information. After all three tasks, our method achieves
an overall performance of 31.56% AP50, compared to 15.07% for the baseline. In theSplit-
Cscenario, the first-stage model struggles due to the increased complexity introduced by
random grouping. In Phase 2, while the baseline focuses on learning the current task, it suf-
fers from severe forgetting of prior knowledge. Conversely, our method balances new task
learning with the retention of earlier information. By Phase 3, the model effectively con- 2THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D

method improves mAP by 5.6%. In this supplementary material, we first demonstrate the performance gains on rare classes
achieved by incorporating the IC module in Appendix C. Next, we provide detailed split in-
formation for all scenarios, based on class names, in Appendix D. Finally, we present a qual-
itative comparison between the baseline method and our proposed approach in Appendix
E. Appendix C Evaluation on Rare Categories
The proposed imbalance correction (IC) module, as detailed in Section 4.2, is designed to
address the performance gap for rare classes. To assess its impact, we compare its perfor-
mance with the framework which has exemplar replay (ER) and knowledge distillation (KD). Specifically, we focus on its ability to improve performance for rare classes, which the model
encounters infrequently compared to more common classes. The results, shown in Tab."

In this section, we present a qualitative comparison of the proposed framework with the
baseline method. Fig. 4 illustrates the results on theSplit-Aevaluation after learning all
tasks, comparing the performance of the baseline method and our proposed approach. As
shown in the figure, our method demonstrates superior instance segmentation performance
compared to the baseline. For example, in row 1, the baseline method fails to segment
thesink, while in row 3, thesofainstance is missed. Overall, our framework consistently
outperforms the baseline, with several missed instances by the baseline highlighted in red 4THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D

How does the proposed method's performance compare to the baseline in the evaluation of Split-A?,"Figure 4: Qualitative comparison of ground truth, the baseline method, and our proposed framework on theSplit-Aevaluation after learning all tasks.","1 to Tab. 4 to highlight the impact of our proposed method
on individual splits across various scenarios. The results clearly demonstrate that our model
consistently retains knowledge of previous tasks better than the baseline. ForSplit-A, our
model shows improvement throughout the phase. In Phase 3 of (s2), although both the base-
line and our method exhibit a performance drop, our method reduces forgetting significantly
compared to the baseline. TheSplit-Bscenario, while more complex thanSplit-A, achieves
comparable results due to semantic similarity among classes within the same task. In Phase
2, our model achieves overall all 43.13% mAP50 compared to 24.53% on baseline, a similar
trend is observed in Phase 3, where our method not only consistently improves learning but
also enhances retention of previous information. After all three tasks, our method achieves
an overall performance of 31.56% AP50, compared to 15.07% for the baseline. In theSplit-
Cscenario, the first-stage model struggles due to the increased complexity introduced by
random grouping. In Phase 2, while the baseline focuses on learning the current task, it suf-
fers from severe forgetting of prior knowledge. Conversely, our method balances new task
learning with the retention of earlier information. By Phase 3, the model effectively con- 2THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D

method improves mAP by 5.6%. In this supplementary material, we first demonstrate the performance gains on rare classes
achieved by incorporating the IC module in Appendix C. Next, we provide detailed split in-
formation for all scenarios, based on class names, in Appendix D. Finally, we present a qual-
itative comparison between the baseline method and our proposed approach in Appendix
E. Appendix C Evaluation on Rare Categories
The proposed imbalance correction (IC) module, as detailed in Section 4.2, is designed to
address the performance gap for rare classes. To assess its impact, we compare its perfor-
mance with the framework which has exemplar replay (ER) and knowledge distillation (KD). Specifically, we focus on its ability to improve performance for rare classes, which the model
encounters infrequently compared to more common classes. The results, shown in Tab.

What does the proposed method's performance demonstrate in relation to the ground truth in the evaluation of Split-C?,"Figure 6: Qualitative comparison of ground truth, the baseline method, and our proposed framework on theSplit-Cevaluation after learning all tasks.","1 to Tab. 4 to highlight the impact of our proposed method
on individual splits across various scenarios. The results clearly demonstrate that our model
consistently retains knowledge of previous tasks better than the baseline. ForSplit-A, our
model shows improvement throughout the phase. In Phase 3 of (s2), although both the base-
line and our method exhibit a performance drop, our method reduces forgetting significantly
compared to the baseline. TheSplit-Bscenario, while more complex thanSplit-A, achieves
comparable results due to semantic similarity among classes within the same task. In Phase
2, our model achieves overall all 43.13% mAP50 compared to 24.53% on baseline, a similar
trend is observed in Phase 3, where our method not only consistently improves learning but
also enhances retention of previous information. After all three tasks, our method achieves
an overall performance of 31.56% AP50, compared to 15.07% for the baseline. In theSplit-
Cscenario, the first-stage model struggles due to the increased complexity introduced by
random grouping. In Phase 2, while the baseline focuses on learning the current task, it suf-
fers from severe forgetting of prior knowledge. Conversely, our method balances new task
learning with the retention of earlier information. By Phase 3, the model effectively con- 2THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D

solidatess1and maintains strong performance across all task splits. Overall, our proposed
method improves mAP by 5.6%. In this supplementary material, we first demonstrate the performance gains on rare classes
achieved by incorporating the IC module in Appendix C. Next, we provide detailed split in-
formation for all scenarios, based on class names, in Appendix D. Finally, we present a qual-
itative comparison between the baseline method and our proposed approach in Appendix
E. Appendix C Evaluation on Rare Categories
The proposed imbalance correction (IC) module, as detailed in Section 4.2, is designed to
address the performance gap for rare classes. To assess its impact, we compare its perfor-
mance with the framework which has exemplar replay (ER) and knowledge distillation (KD). Specifically, we focus on its ability to improve performance for rare classes, which the model
encounters infrequently compared to more common classes. The results, shown in Tab.

5 and Tab. 6, correspond to evaluations onSplit-AforPhase
2andPhase 3, respectively. InPhase 2, we evaluate classes seen 1–20 times per epoch,
whilePhase 3targets even less frequent classes, with observations limited to 1–10 times per
epoch. As illustrated in Tab. 5, the IC module substantially improves performance on rare
classes in terms of mAP 50 in Phase 2 ofSplit-A. For instance, classes likerecycling
binandtrash bin, seen only 3 and 7 times, respectively, shows significant improvement
when the IC module is applied. Overall, the IC module provides an average boost of 8.32%,
highlighting its effectiveness in mitigating class imbalance. Similarly, Tab. 6 presents results forPhase 3, demonstrating significant gains for infre-
quent classes. For example, even though the classes such aspiano,bucket, andlaundry
basketare observed only once, IC module improves the performance by 52.30%, 10.40%,
and 13.60%, respectively. The ER+KD module does not focus on rare classes likeshower
andtoasterwhich results in low performance, but the IC module compensates for this imbal-
ance by focusing on underrepresented categories. On average, the addition of the proposed THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D3

Tab. 7 presents the task splits for each proposed scenario introduced in Section 4.3 using the
ScanNet200 dataset. The three scenarios,Split-A,Split-B, andSplit-C, are each divided
into three tasks: Task 1, Task 2, and Task 3. Notably, the order of classes in these tasks is
random. Appendix E Qualitative Results
In this section, we present a qualitative comparison of the proposed framework with the
baseline method. Fig. 4 illustrates the results on theSplit-Aevaluation after learning all
tasks, comparing the performance of the baseline method and our proposed approach. As
shown in the figure, our method demonstrates superior instance segmentation performance
compared to the baseline. For example, in row 1, the baseline method fails to segment
thesink, while in row 3, thesofainstance is missed. Overall, our framework consistently
outperforms the baseline, with several missed instances by the baseline highlighted in red 4THENGANE ET AL.: CLIMB-3D
