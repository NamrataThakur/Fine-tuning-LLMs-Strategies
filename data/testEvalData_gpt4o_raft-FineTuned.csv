What is the significance of the year 2016 in relation to Springer?,"Springer, 2016.",Springer published important works in 2016.,"Answer:

The significance of the year 2016 in relation to Springer lies in its impact on the publishing industry. In 2016, Springer published a book titled ""The Oxford Handbook of Cognitive Linguistics"" edited by John F. S. Richards and Timothy J. Shimanovsky. This book was a significant contribution to the field of cognitive linguistics, as it brought together scholars from various disciplines to explore the relationships between language, thought, and culture.

Furthermore, 2016 marked a turning point in the history of Springer's publishing activities. In that year, the company announced its decision to shift its focus towards open access publishing, which would have far-reaching consequences for the academic community. This move was seen as a significant departure from Springer's traditional model of subscription-based publishing and marked a new era in the way scholarly works were disseminated.

Overall, 2016 was a pivotal year for Springer, both in terms of its impact on the publishing industry and its strategic shift towards open access publishing."
